The villa stays 4-10+ persons and is perfect for the large family, two families with children or couples/friends travelling together.

The villa has five bedrooms on two levels, all with en suite bathrooms. The master bedroom, is situated on a floor between the upper and the lower floor. The other four bedrooms are located at the ground floor. All bedrooms are facing the pool. The second and third bedroom share a spacious bathroom . So does the fourth and fifth bedroom. All bedrooms are equipped with comfortable queen or king size beds and roomy wardrobes. Its possible to put an extra bed or baby cot in one of the bedrooms. Passambhati villa has a very well-equipped kitchen as we love cooking, with tableware for 10+ persons. Our kitchen is known and loved by the best local chefs on the island. And we will be glad to help you arrange a chef coming to cook for you in the villa. If you would like breakfast service, this can be ordered from our reception. On both sides of the kitchen you will find nice dining terraces. A lush tropical garden with orchids and palm trees surrounds the villa.
The villa is also equipped with free wifi, TV and safety boxes.

In the evening you can chill in our stunning lounge sala. With a 270° view over the horizon watching the magnificent sunsets.

Passambhati Villa is personally decorated with carefully selected items from all around Thailand.

Our sweet housekeeper Mon is here to help you with the daily cleaning and making your bedrooms. Other than this, it’s a self-contained household.

You are welcome to use our reception at Cape Shark Villas. We are here to help you book any activity you would like to try on the island. Yoga, massage, boat trips around the island, diving and snorkelling, motorbike rental and so on.

Guest access
Renting Passambhati Villa gives you full access to the whole house. Please note, that
only the persons registered as guests are allowed in the villa. No outside guests are allowed.
Other things to note
Our housekeeper Mon will clean the villa inside and outside, and make your beds every day.
Please keep in mind that she is here to take care of the villa, she doesn't cook or take care of your personal belongings.
If you appreciate her services, please feel free to tip her upon your departure:-).
Mon´s English is not 100 % fluent, but usually there is no problem in understanding each other.

To Thian Og Bay and Sai Daeng Beach, the two closest (and very beautiful) beaches, it takes about 10 minutes to walk. There will be steep hills on the way. There are bars and restaurants on the beaches with lovely Thai food as well as Western food like burgers, salads and Pizza.

Besides the free shuttle bus service you can also go by local taxis or rent motorbikes.
Since the island has steep hills and narrow roads in many places, you need to be a good driver to rent a motorbike.

Apart from motorbike and taxi, there are other ways of getting around the island. You could rent a long tail boat and take beach stops - snorkelling wherever you like on your way around the island, and why not have your lunch in a small nice restaurant on a beach. There are several!

We strongly recommend you to discover this beautiful island with all its small and charming secluded beaches and viewpoints. Your ultimate guide to this you can easily find on the internet at www.kohtaocompleteguide.com

The closest supermarket is located just outside the village of Chalok called Aukotan Supermarket. You will pass it on your drive to the villa. Here you will find most of the things you need, except meat, fresh bread, fruit and vegetables.

For fresh fruit, vegetables, and herbs, we recommend you continue along the road outside Aukotan, away from Chalok towards Mae Haad village. On the left hand side you will find a small market where you can get these things. Here, they also have all kinds of fish and seafood.

For freshly baked bread and croissants, we recommend the French bakery in Chalok or Mae Haad called Cappuccino Bakery and Bistro. In Mae Haad you also find the Cafe Del Sol offering freshly baked bread.
For meat, you will need to go to a shop called Pods in the village of Mae Haad.

If you need to have some clothes washed please ask our housekeeper Mon, and she will wash it for you at 100 Baht per kilo. Please pay her in cash up front. Please note that you are not allowed to use the laundry room by yourself!,

Comment: Deena
December 2019
This is a gorgeous property that exceeds expectations and we loved our time there. Sweeping ocean views, beautiful and comfortable architecture and a lovely full-time housekeeper that will help you with everything from groceries whenever you need them to laundry to daily cleaning.

The owner Siri was a pleasure to communicate with as she was super helpful with all trip details. We messaged her a grocery list before arrival and she helped set up a chef to cook at the villa one night which was really special for our group. Other nights, we ordered food from menus at the villa.

There are a couple of sandy beaches within walking distance. The closest one was 10-15 min of walking. We thought that the one that was a bit farther away (20 min?) was great for swimming and totally worth walking to.

Grab doesn't work here, but it was easy to get a taxi/tuk tuk by calling the office that manages the property.

I highly recommend this villa as a special place that's very much worth visiting!

The villa is absolutely amazing, in top condition and simply wonderful. Mon is great and helped us with everything around the house, including shopping and arranging a private chef for one evening. Ed, the chef, organized a lovely dinner for us, excellent food ans wine and we went to his restaurant many times during our stay.

The villa was sparkle clean and Mon really helps with anything you may need. Also the CSV reception is only a minute away and they also assist with booking massages, taxis etc.

Other things to note
*** PLEASE NOTE, BEACH TIDES APRIL - SEPTEMBER ***
Many beaches along the South and West coast have shallow waters at seasonal times.
From APRIL TO SEPTEMBER, Beach turns into a huge playground with low tide, where the waters will be shallow here with a slightly higher tide in the evenings and more a calm sea. Swimming during the day won't be possible, but the evenings bring more water to have a cool dip. It's a great spot for kids to play in. The beach turns into a huge playground, great for walks, shell and crab picking and safe to stroll & run around freely. There is also an array of Pools around the island to use during low tide and many other beaches close by to visit and explore as well!
I can provide a tide table to check the best moment to swim during the day.

*** PLEASE NOTE PARTIES *** On Friday night, from the villa, we can hear a party called Sabai Bay and located few hundred meters away from the villa. They usually turn off music after midnight. Let's then go dancing!,

This villa looks exactly as pictured if not better. There is tons of space in the room with very updated appliances and the view of the beach from the porch is beautiful! It was very quiet, except for some pool maintenance in the mornings, and the staff was so helpful and kind. Would stay here again in a heart beat!

This is a great, private little villa. My husband and I stayed here for a couple nights for our honeymoon and we loved it! Very comfortable bed, clean room, excellent and accommodating staff, and a beautiful location.

May 2022
My husband and I had a wonderful stay! So much so, that we ended up staying an extra night and opted for an upgrade view for the entire stay. The location was everything we wanted — Quiet, intimate, and convenient. It was about 10 minutes from the pier with local restaurant close by. We drove and took a car ferry over, so the last thing we wanted to do was drive another 45 minutes to where all popular main stream hotels are. There’s not that many villas here so you get a very boutique resort feel (we wanted something like this and we hate overcrowding.) The staff was so lovely from the front desk to the wait staff. The rooms were exactly as pictured and there were free snacks and soft drinks in the mini bar. The wifi was good as well. I was working NYC hours through most nights and all my online meetings went off without a hitch. We would love to come back here.

My wife and I stayed a night here and it was quite pleasant being able to jump in the pool and walk on the beach for sunset. The reception was extremely friendly as well.

The only reason for 4 stars is because even though there was basically no one else in the villa complex, we got the room with probably the least ideal view. We also had a couple right next door to us. It just confuses me when there are so many villas in the complex but we get put in one with not much of a view AND right next to another couple.

Other than that is was a very nice stay.

Great location, definitely recommend a car rental if you decide to stay here. 12 minutes from chaweng beach and fisherman’s. House looks exactly like the photos, clean and easy to access. A lot of stairs because it’s a 3 story home. Down side is that you have to pay extra for the electricity usage, we stayed for 3 nights and left the ac on because the house would’ve been really hot without it on and ended up paying $60 for electricity. Also be aware that ants will come out if you leave any food or open chip bags out on the counter in the kitchen.

Hi Ed,
Good to hear that you enjoyed your stay and liked the villa. For anyone else reading this, as with most villas on Samui, electricity is charged separately. We charge at cost only and don't make any profit out of this. The average cost from all our previous guests is 350 baht per day which is what Ed paid. It can vary from around 200 to 500 baht per day depending on whether all the ACs in the villa are left on 24/7. Best regards,
Nick

The house was exactly as listed - huge and clean, definitely able to accommodate many guests, with clean sheets and towels in all rooms and very walkable to Choeng Mon beach. Sound system was great as well in the house and outside at the pool area. We also visited the clubhouse where the gym was and the equipment was well kept and sufficient for a good workout. Didn’t have a chance to play tennis but the court was also well-maintained and we saw many people playing.

All villas had to lower their volumes from 10pm onwards to 7am, which was a considerate restriction especially if you have an early start the next day which we often had.

Nick, our host, was very responsive and helpful pre, during and post check-out which is always a bonus! During our stay, our villa manager was helpful and very responsive as well, so all our needs were handled promptly.

The villa itself is absolutely gorgeous and modern, and the view from the pool was excellent, overlooking the beach and the surrounding island. All in all, two thumbs up and definitely recommended!

I haven't given a 2 star review to any business till date, this would be my first one.To start off, during our 5 day stay at the place, no one had come to clean the place during our stay. Upon asking about it, the host said that cleaning was done before checking in already (which by the way is a requirement, not an extra service) I screenshot our entire conversation and sent it to him, and it seems like his English was poor that he didnt even understand what he replied "yes" to. So I tried to ask him for fresh towels, no need for the cleaning as the conversation wasnt going anywhere. He told me fresh towels each time would be 300฿(50฿×6). I went to buy my own towels. At this point, I wasnt feeling good about communicating with him.

And a bigger issue arises. The airconditioner on the master bedroom (which me my husband and 2 young children were sleeping in) started making really loud sounds, I went to sleep out on the sofa hoping the kids wouldnt wake up and hoping that it was just a temporary issue We shut the air in the morning, and went back to sleep without it. (Also, atleast 3 remotes (ac,tv) werent working in the house probably didnt change batteries.)

The next day we were out most of the day and at some point we came back and turn3d on the ac of master for 10 mins, there was no sound so we thought ok maybe it wont happen again. We went out again and came back, got ready to sleep, 15 minutes into turning the ac, the loud sounds came again. This time much louder, and it started leaking near plugpoints. ( It was really loud, not the sound of a minor issue.) so this is 10pm and nobody couldve come fixed the ac at this point. We decided to all sleep on the floor of the living room. ALSO, the master doesnt have a bedroom door, so we were still hearing the loud sounds! The next day (the day of checkout) i messaged the host about it. The cleaner and the building maintenance staff came to see the situation , we spoke in Thai and they asked me, how I managed to sleep here. And The host decided to not reply to my chat or didnt take any responsibility for what had happened. He said it had never happened before and maybe it was just minor? The building staff and maid told me the air needs to be removed and piping needs to be completely redone, so clearly its not a minor issue! He just dismissed my complaint entirely, and hadnt answered my chat. The view was beautiful from the living and thats the only reason for not giving a 1 star review.

Great place to stay for a group of 8-10 people. It is beachfront and we enjoyed the beach and kayak.

It is far from the main beaches (Chawaeng etc) and getting around we need a car/van. There are restaurants nearby and you can also order from restaurants.

Overall, a great place to stay for a large group.

Our first major trip in 3 years.
Steve is a wonderful host. Stayed on top of communications.
The photos are exactly what you see. Backyard leads up to beautiful view of the ocean.
This property is a tad bit far from Central Mall and some popular dinning area. If you do not have a car plan ahead for transportation. Or rent a moped.
The Mud Restaurant (walking distance) provide great options if you do not want to drive out to town.
Everyone in the group said "will stay at this property again."

We had a great stay at Steve's place. It is perfect for a family. We enjoyed the view and walking out quite far on the beach. The pool and gardens are lovely. The house is comfortable and Nada the helper is great. We enjoyed seeing her each day as she popped in to do a bit of cleaning. We appreciated this. She made dinner for us one night which was delicious. There is also a community pool that my kids enjoyed. There is a nice Italian restaurant on the beach not too far away that we also enjoyed. Nothing is too far in Ko Samui so we did not feel that we were too far from anything but we did have a car. Overall, this is a comfortable home and you will feel relaxed here. We would love to come again.

As a previous visitor stated, my stay at Indu Beach Villa was the highlight of my vacation. Everything was perfect, from the shallow waters of the private beach, the amazing sunsets to Pom's delicious cooking. The location was perfect as it's close enough to more touristy areas yet far enough for privacy and serenity. A stay here is a must when visiting Ko Samui.

A great villa, with an even better view.
The worst thing about the villa was that if made you not want to leave to experience Samui. The daily views were fantastic… then comes sunset. We spent all but one evening in/around the pool enjoying the spectacular sunset.

Inside, the villa was equipped with everything we needed. We did a fair amount of cooking during our stay, and had ample kitchen equipment. The decor was nice as well.

The location is a bit tricky to find at first. We drove ourselves there, had we taken the transfer, it would have been simple. Once you find it the first time, getting in and out is easy. Beyond that, the location suited us perfectly. It’s in a very quiet and upscale area of the island, but, defiantly not inconveniently out of the way. We drove out and about every day, and it was always an efficient journey too and from the villa.

Roger and the local team were very helpful and informative. They provided a friendly reception and gave good recommendations.

While visiting, my family and I even took a little time to look at some villas that were on the market for sale, and I must say, overall Blanka’s was right up there with the best of them! I wouldn’t hesitate to return, or recommend it to friends / family.

Perfect place to spend a week away. Anything we needed (rental car, in-suite cook, in-suite massages, tickets to events, food delivery, grocery runs) was super easy to get. The space was amazing - we kept remarking on how comfortable the beds were and how perfect the temperature in the pool was. Can't wait to come back!

The place was comfortable, clean and modern. We hired a private chef for the last night and was the perfect setting. Unfortunately we hit construction when we where there so there was some noise and was less private feeling. Other than that the area was great secluded and quiet. This is great if you are looking to get away from tourist heavy area. Also is a walkable to the beach and Six Sense Resort.

Blanka is an awesome host. Super responsive and very supportive. The villa, the views and the overall appearance of the villa are excellent. Everything is well maintained and taken care of. Lovely stay overall 👍 we will certainly come back. We have also seen the other villas of Blanka during our stay - she takes extraordinary care of style, cleanliness and customer experience

"If you’re not barefoot then you're overdressed”

Discover island life at this unique beach house set on a private 1,600 sqm of stunning beach land with 32 m beach frontage on Koh Samui’s northeastern shore. First built as a Thai fishing house on an enviable beachside plot, the property has been lovingly renovated.

Retaining some of its rustic charms, Kya Beach House is an idyllic 3 bedroom beachside holiday home, offering it’s very own private beach garden and pool. With the Gulf Of Thailand lapping at its feet, laid back is the lifestyle and with 5 km’s of Baan Po’s white sandy beach forming part of the extended garden, beach life is there for the taking.

Understanding island living and how to live it well, Kya Beach House has been designed to offer guests beach life with a twist of shabby chic luxury. The open plan living room sits centre stage to the pool and beach with a stylish beachy feel bathed in the tones of the surroundings. Guests can relax back on the sumptuous sofas drenched in island views and if they choose can enjoy the multi-media entertainment system with 55" HD Smart TV. The system comes complete with multilingual TV channels and integrated surround sound speakers throughout the indoor and outdoor living areas.

Chill
Tropical living seamlessly fuses with outdoor chic as the large 50sqm open-air covered sala located by the sea invites guests to enjoy life by the beach in gorgeous island style. The large private sand garden with 32 m of beach frontage is the ultimate sun deck for the sun worshippers and a wonderful space for children to dig their toes into the sand and play, offering guests their own private beach space. By night the staff transform the sunbeds to an outdoor chill zone for guests to recline in total comfort and enjoy the spectacular sunset vistas. The beach garden also offers guests a wonderful opportunity to enjoy pamper time with a designated covered massage sala right next to the shoreline.

Dine
Offering a cool alfresco dining lifestyle fused with comfort, the large bamboo dining table is located in the beach garden with a jack fruit tree offering shade. The dining area comfortably seats 9 and is positioned close to the open plan kitchen, pool and sala. Should the weather turn, the dining area is easily re-located to under the sala. The custom-built western kitchen forms part of the indoor open plan design and offers guests a home away from home feel, furnished with all possible cooking accessories. The large dining island gives guests a dining alternative should they wish to dine with the a/c’s on. BBQ dining in the beach garden is also possible and has been built close to the outdoor dining area for ease.

Sleep
Kya Beach House offers a beautiful once in a lifetime experience of true beach life in a dreamy island setting with gorgeous bedroom sanctuaries. Each of the 3 master bedroom suites has been designed with beachy elegance. King size beds draped with mosquito nets and sofa areas offer guests inviting bedroom retreats with a choice of air-conditioning or overhead fan. Each bedroom has an individual nature, the garden bedroom overlooks its private beach garden with star gazing deck in complete privacy. The upstairs vaulted ceiling bedroom is flanked in endless sea views and has an utter beach house feel to it. The separate bungalow bedroom has a stunning pool and beach views from each oversized window with surrounding terrace.

Service
Kya Beach House offers a team of two full time staff with English speaking Villa Manager working daily from 8am – 5pm.

Swim
The 4m x 8m terrazzo infinity pool, boasts a private beachfront landscape, ideal for a cooling salt-water swim with submerged sun deck and shallow end for children’s enjoyment. Guests can recline back and relax on the pool bench seat with endless sea views and perhaps offers the ideal spot for the nightly ritual of Bang Po’s stunning sunset performances. Should guests prefer a beach swim, the tantalizing sea is just a few metres away for their enjoyment. Dependent on the season guests can enjoy a cooling sea swim and venture out to the reef for some kaleidoscopic snorkelling action. Paddleboards and kayaks can also be arranged for guest’s enjoyment.

Description: About this space
“One’s destination is never a place, but a new way of seeing things.”

Does the allure of sun-drenched days overlooking turquoise waters complete with an infinity-edged pool, swim-up bar and own private seafront chill lounge appeal?

Or possibly spectacular sunset vistas reclining on sumptuous sofas, cocktail in hand, with staff preparing a delicious seafood BBQ are more what you are looking for. Then, the search ends, and Villa Nagisa offers it all!
The space
We wish your stay at Nagisa will turn you from travellers into storytellers! (Relax, unwind, Eat, Swim, Play, Laugh, Sleep and REPEAT!)

The Space
The villa itself sits on a generous 800 sqm plot in the elite location of Plai Laem, lapped by the azure Gulf of Thailand waters. Each of the elegant 4 master bedrooms is generous in size and affords unending sea views with its own private terraces. En-suite bathrooms have been highly appointed with rain showers and oversized bathtubs big enough for two.

The living room and kitchen ideally located on the pool level, fuse perfectly with the wrap-around terrace, optimizing the best of island living, with the beauty of both indoor and alfresco living yours for the taking.

The large sundeck complete with covered dining and sofa seating as well as multiple sun lounges is emersed in sea views. The organic shaped 20m infinity pool offers guests a refreshing swim or the swim-up bar for cool refreshments or perhaps just a chill in the spa-like jacuzzi, each gorgeous to enjoy.

Beautiful interiors thoughtfully designed to encompass the best of luxury island living are immaculately maintained by the highly experienced villa manager and team, ensuring guests live their best life, whilst staying with us.

Sunsets on the bean bags at the water’s edge are breathtaking to watch with the sun dipping into the sea right in front of the villa, these truly are the best seats on the island!

Nagisa offers a true feel of being on your very own private island getaway!

Getting around is easy to navigate when you stay at our villas. Most of our guests prefer to choose a luxury car or limo van, for self-drive or with your own personal driver offering convenience, safety and complete peace of mind while exploring all the island has to offer.

This was easily the most perfect Airbnb experience that I have ever had. The place itself was incredibly beautiful with breathtaking views, plus it was spotlessly clean as well as private. Meow and Khun T were available for every need and went above and beyond to be hospitable. We had a small wedding there thatIvy

Thanks for everything! My family and friends had a spectacular time staying at villa Nagasi. The 4 huge bedrooms and bathrooms were plenty spacious for the 6 of us staying there. Every bedroom comes with a huge bathtub with jets as well!!! The living room was comfortable, the kitchen was fully stocked, and the view of the ocean was absolutely stunning. I loooove this villa and my family is already planning another trip. The photos and descriptions are super accurate, and the only downside during our stay was that the Internet was a little spoty.

Khun Maew and khun T were so nice and we loved the seafood barbecue dinner they prepared as well as the complimentary continental breakfast each morning. We also enjoyed the huge TV in the living room. It was easy to use and there were tons of movies to choose from. Thanks again and I would definitely recommend this villa!!!

Thanks Jenna and we are glad you had such a good time. Khun Meow and T really enjoyed having you stay and appreciate your kind words. We would love to see you and your family back here again and look forward to welcoming you. Sorry about the internet but sometimes we have theses issues and they are frustrating but unfortunately it is part of island life and it sounds like you had plenty of other things to do to keep yourselves occupied.

Best wishes from all of us at Team Nagisa.

Awesome place. Large and lavish with all the modern furnishings. Love the pool overlooking the beach. Its an awesome place that I will go to again and for a month. The only downside, is that Samui does not have many good beaches other than chaweng. The beach in front of Villa Nagisa is not swimable. Its very rocky. Other than the beach, its simply awesome. A place for the family and friends. Well furnished, and high living. Cant fault it. Staff is great. Views are spectacular.

The villa is absolutely gorgeous. Meow and Tee are very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. The In villa Massages by Pat were absolutely amazing and relatively reasonable (starting at 900 TBH for 1hour). The villa was always sparkling clean the view is just out of the world, specially at night. I would recommend the place to everyone!

This villa exceeded our expectations in every way. As beautiful as the pictures portray it, it is even better in person. The villa is in a quiet neighborhood surrounded by similar style villas. It is extremely private. It has absolutely stunning views of the sea.

The staff are extremely accommodating. The are happy to take care of your every need. It's only about 200m walk to get to the beach near Six Senses, and Tongson Beach is also very near. There is a minimart within about 15 minutes walk for some groceries, and there are several dining options within a similar walking distance. It's recommended to rent a motorbike or car if you want to go much further.

This is a great choice for families or couples looking for a true 5 star luxury island stay. We will definitely book again.

We were a party of four adults looking to relax, chill and be carefree. Villa Nagisa was the perfect place. The tranquil surroundings, the beautiful accommodation and the friendly staff, Nong and Arm made it very difficult to leave Villa Nagisa after spending 5 days there.
The villa was clean and well equipped. The views from all areas of the villa were just breathtaking.
Nong and Arm were obliging and always ready to attend to our needs but also gave us our privacy.
Nong is a great cook and we highly recommend that you try some of her delicious meals she can prepare inhouse.
The vast movie selection was an added bonus for lazy rainy afternoons.
We all had a fabulous and memorable stay at Villa Nagisa and would highly recommend to stay there.

August 2016
We had a great stay at Villa Nagisa. The place was just like the pictures. One of the big reasons we chose this villa was it included staff and that was key. we haven't been to Koh Samui before and with them doing the meals and organizing activities it felt like being at a high end resort. I so glad we chose this place for that reason and Meow and Te were awesome!!! Food was great and anything we needed was instantly arranged. The listing warns of construction and during the day they are working next door but that had no impact on us. It was just our family with three boys but you could have had a second family easily.

Description: About this space
SHA++ certified villa which means has net the government health and safety requirements.


Rates include a daily continental or asian breakfast, full-time staff, one return airport transfer, concierge service, English speaking villa manager and a Thai chef with food costs added to guests account.


Secret Beach Villa overlooks the secluded and pristine Haad Thong Lang Beach. Guests are afforded an essentially private beach which can be reached by taking a few steps down from the villa.
The space
Everyday stresses melt away at this oceanfront 6-bedroom Koh Phangan villa, sleeping 8 adults and 4 kids. The villa can only be reached by speedboat or ferry, and overlooks a private beach offering access to coral gardens full of tropical fish. Suffice to say, you'll feel like the outside world is a million miles behind.

Enjoy the solitude alongside luxury extras, including a private pool, sauna, TV game room, gym, sea kayaks and personal chef.

There's a reason this tropical retreat is called Secret Beach Villa. Occupying a luscious jungle-backed location, it genuinely feels off the beaten path - the far-flung getaway of your Koh Phangan dreams.

Ease into the zen-like bliss of island life and take a splash in your private pool. Watch the kids play on the castaway-style beach below. This private strip of sand is fronted by a sleepy bay with calm waters, and there's a kayak available if you feel like exploring further.
After your morning dip, head to the massage sala for a yoga session, spa treatment, manicure or pedicure - all easily arranged by the villa staff. Feel like getting more energetic? The villa has a fully equipped gym. Floor-to-ceiling glass showcase the ocean and hillsides while you pump iron or hit the treadmill.

Inside, an open living/dining/kitchen space feels fresh and contemporary, set beneath a beautiful vaulted ceiling. Unwind in front of the living area's wall-mounted TV. Enjoy ice-cold drinks and snacks at the kitchen bar. Or challenge the kids to a game on the full-size pool table.

When you're ready to eat, share a lazy lunch around the pool table - it doubles as a dining table! Or ask the staff to fire up the barbecue on the front deck. Dig into a Thai-inspired feast at the covered outdoor dining table. Then sleep off lunch in the nearby chill-out lounge.

The villa enjoys some of the best sunsets on the island. Come evening, soft reds and pinks splash across the bay - the perfect backdrop to end-of-day cocktails.

Ready to slumber? The Principal Villa has three bedrooms. Claim the inviting master bedroom (on the upper floor) and enjoy breakfast in your king bed - accompanied by a stunning 180-degree view across the bay. A bath tub, separate shower, and double sinks await in the master en-suite.

On the ground floor, the Family Suite has two bedrooms. Grown-ups can snooze in a plush king bed, while the connected kids' bedroom lets little ones camp out between two sofa beds. Both share an en-suite bathroom.

For couples, seclusion and luxury define a stay in the Honeymoon Villa - just a few steps from the beach. Along with a king bed, this romantic retreat boasts its own sauna, a jetted bath, separate kitchenette, and direct access to the pool and fitness room.

The Beach Villa is another great option for families, offering a king bed and a separate living area that transforms into a kid-friendly second bedroom. Added highlights include a separate kitchenette, an en-suite bathroom, and access to a scenic outdoor terrace with a 4-person dining table.

We want you to enjoy the holiday of a lifetime. To give you an experience that lets you truly relax and rejuvenate. That's why everything about our service is tailored to you. Nothing less than 5-star luxury.

For instance, you'll have a resident Thai chef to prepare lunch and dinner from the in-villa menus. Your chef will buy fresh seafood and produce from the market on a daily basis, then prepare and serve your gourmet meal in the comfort of your villa.

Our 5-star service also means giving you high-end services, including in-villa spa treatments, an in-house concierge to book day trips and boat tours, and resident staff to keep the villa immaculate throughout your stay. From the moment you arrive, you'll also have an English-speaking manager to attend to your personal needs.


You'll feel like you've discovered a hidden island getaway when you reach the Secret Beach Villa. Located on the north west coast of Koh Phangan, it can only be reached by private speedboat or ferry.

Once here, you'll feel a wonderful sense of seclusion. But you're only seven minutes from a small fishing village with great restaurants and shops. Enjoy European and Thai food, pick up fresh warm bread from the bakery, or sprawl on the village's own gorgeous beach.

For an easy day trip, head to the quiet island of Koh Ma. Connected to Koh Phangan by a sandbar on Had Mae Had beach, it's a fantastic destination for snorkeling and sunbathing.

March 2019
Would absolutely recommend to anyone to stay!! The place was gorgeous, complete with the main house and pool house, private pool overlooking the beach and kayaks where you could get a great view of sunset. Yvonne provided some snacks and water but she did offer to get groceries in advance which I would highly recommend because a store is about a ten minute walk. Yvonne went above and beyond in planning us a boat excursion and coordinating drivers for us to take us around the island. We are so happy and grateful

We made the best choice to stay at this beach front villa for our family vacation. The villa is much more beautiful than we expected!
Thanks to Yvonne and Tuen, they are super nice and helpful. As we were travelling with a 8 month baby and a 5 yrs girl, they have prepared everything that we asked to make our stay more easier.
Location is a bit far from the city but that is what we want, less busy and is very easy to drive to the city for food or shopping. Kids love the pool and we stayed at the villa most of the time.

Never recommend enough for this place.
Thanks to Kob who made our stay the best one. Local welcome with cold roasted coconut when we arrived from a very longgg journey, super refreshing! They really think of their guests as they prepared some bread, eggs, butter, and milk in the fridge. So we can cook something easy and get some rest before starting off the next day. Kob is like our Guru for this trip, she recommend good breakfast restaurant (only down the road with fabulous view of Samui sea), small trip to Koh Phangan and she even arranged everything for us. After a half day trip we decided to stay HOME! The house is very well furnished and clean. White tone decoration which gives you a very claim atmosphere and with a private pool right in the front of the living room! Very quite and relaxing. Would definitely come back and bring couple of friends as they have more beautiful houses in town. Thank you for making our trip better than what we expected!!!

Cheers!

Best Airbnb in a long time (maybe ever) ! We were met with a guide who checked us in, drove us to the place, and sent us some local written guides.

Stay: There was quick and frequent towel service. Laundry service was effective, cost friendly, and fast. The place was clean, had all the right things, and felt luxurious.

Overall a great value with no compromises on comfort or anything else. Would stay again.

We had an outstanding stay at the Loft Ko Phangan. The organization was just brilliant.
The hosts were so nice and helped us well everytime. They provided us nice recommendations during our stay.

The Loft was super clean and super nice equipped, we had everything we need.
Waking up with the seaview was just amazing.
The location was great with a 7/11 around the corner and some really nice restaurants.
Highly recommend the Loft for a relaxing stay at a beautiful island with the best hosts!
Thanks for everything ☺️

It was a pleasure to stay in Rachel & Stu’s Beach Loft. We can truly say that they treat customers like family. The communication was perfect from the first moment. For any questions we always got an answer and felt well supported from the beginning to the end. The location is just amazing, because it’s a really quiet and beautiful place. The beach loft was exactly like shown in Airbnb. It’s a really cosy house with a comfy bed, a beautiful terrace and a great shower. It was very clean and well decorated. It was a great experience to be Rachel & Stu’s guests. Hope to see you soon again wish you all the best. Robert 😊

Everything is so easy with Mica! Very helpful and friendly.

The house is as great as on the photos! 🤩

I totally recommend this house and Mica👍🏻

Our stay at Life’s a beach was fantastic! Great
Host, Mica was very friendly and helpful with us , a beautiful ocean view from the balcony. We had a rented bike, what made touring
around easy.
The villa was very spacy, good beds and very comfortable. We
definitely want to come back!

August 2022
We had a great few days staying here. To start of Mica is an amazing host, he was super helpful such as him picking us up from the ferry port and showing us around town. He also gave us the numbers of a laundry and taxi service to use which were very reliable. The villa was like the pictures clean and spacious for two people. Unfortunately we were not able to swim in the sea that much as it was quite shallow at the time of year we stayed but having access to the hotel next door allowed us to use the pool there. Also it is very easy to explore the islands beaches where swimming was possible in a taxi. From the house we were in walking distance to a few shops / restaurants which was helpful. Overall would definitely recommend! Thank you Mica !!!

Thank you Alexandra for your fantastic review. I would please like to add that concerning the tides effect in the Southern & Western part of Koh pha-Ngan, it is for this reason that I took the time to clearly explain it in the description of the house 🙂🙏🏼

Perfect stay, super nice Villa with a great view over to Koh Samui. Everything super clean, great location, right on the beach. Perfect hosts, Mica and Sea. Lovely, with a personal welcome at Thong Sala Pier. They help, wherever they can. Absolutely recommended. For sure, we come again😊
Alessandro
August 2022
The villa is located on a very nice beach on the lagoon, affected by the tide but offers a beautiful view and beautiful walks. Located a short distance from downtown but you need a scooter to get around. The house is perfect, equipped with everything.
He's the superhost par excellence! Always available and cozy, with great tips. Rental and laundry service are available upon request. Highly recommended, we felt right at home!

We had a perfect stay at Mica's villa and wish we could have stayed longer. Mica personally picks you up from the pier and directly gave us a small city tour with recommendations for restaurants, bakeries, etc. He also provides a flyer at the villa with important info and a map of Koh Phangan for sightseeing.
He arranges everything if you ask him to do it and is incredibly helpful. If there are any problems, they will be resolved within a few minutes.
Mica knows a scooter rental shop you can trust, so there shouldn't be any nasty surprises.
The villa itself is very nice and stylishly decorated, everything is cleaned and tidy daily (if you want) and even the dishes are washed. The kitchen is better equipped than my own, you won't miss anything here and if so, I'm sure Mica would get it in no time.
The location directly on the beach is a dream. From the balcony you have a very nice view and there are private loungers available to relax.
Guests of the villa may use the pool of the resort next door.
100% recommendation. If you book with Mica, you will not only get a place to sleep, but an all-around carefree package. :)

We loved our stay here. We didn’t want to leave!! This villa is so unique and just beautiful. It is on top of a big hill which gives such a special view and quiet experience. This villa is so close to great places but also tucked away so it’s calm and private. Highly recommend! Also, the property manager Grace went above and beyond to help us before we arrived and after we left. She organized our transportation and helped us find things to do. 10/10 experience!!

With our 2 kids at the age of 6 and 10 years old, we absolutely loved the setting, beautiful design and facilities of the accommodation.
It was great to have our private swimming pool, the kids really enjoyed swimming at night!
The climb to the top of the mountain to the villa was a challenge, but durable enough and we made it our daily exercise 😊 really enjoyed everything and would definitely recommend this to others 💖
Special thanks to Grace, which was a great host during our stay

location is great, nivce views! super helpful staff (thank you grace!). but thins are not too close (you need a motobike), but i would not dare to drive the steep hill.. but everything was nice and super uncomplicated! we liked it a lot!!

Beautiful place with a stunning view. Had an amazing time there and would definitely go again. I'd recommend renting a scooter to get around and be aware that the hill to get up there is very steep.

Absolutely loved my stay here, I hope to be back soon. Treated myself to a relaxing solo retreat/working holiday and couldn't have asked for a better spot. Privately located on the top of a (super) steep hill with stunning sea views and a lovely little swimming pool. Tastefully decorated home with comfortable working space and lovely outdoor kitchen and bathroom. Comfortable bed with stunning ocean view - even slept without aircon, mosquito net, and sea breeze some nights.

If you're someone who loves nature and outdoor living, and don't mind being among the geckos, birds, insects... you'll love this place.

Very nice place exactly as seen on the photos. Very good value for the Money. It is a bit up the hill (only like 150meter but very step) so older / disabled people might have some trouble getting up & down. Very nice manager, she had a lot of useful Tipps and supported us with things like taxi, ferry and scooter.

Our stay in Koh Phangan was exquisite , our choice is about this "adventure" house. We were not disappointed: we could see Lizard Gecko, snake, rat, frog, different birds. Access is easy. We rented 2 150cc scooters so we could climb the coast, which is paved. The pool was much appreciated by the children!
The bedroom upstairs gives an incredible view: the bedding is very good. The mosquito net and cover reassures... and yes a small Gecko shared the stay with us ... but they are very fearful, he hid in the frame and from time to time he came out his little head .
We will keep a pleasant memory of this.
Look -:
The neighborhood is moving, unfortunately we were greeted with a hammer grill for much of our days .
And a neighboring villa in techno mode at night.
[As for the house equipment, the pool used material is damaged /stained: much different from the photos .
The mattresses at the bottom need to be changed as they are too hard even for children.]
A big thank you to Thanks who was very welcoming and was very attentive to us.

The house offers a total change of scenery.
Crazy view!
It is perfectly located, beaches and restaurants close by.
It is well equipped, kitchen, good bedding.
It is suitable for nature and animal lovers, as he walks there, toad, lizards and spiders .
The weaknesses, the slightly sporty access and the soundproofing of the room.

We really enjoyed the location of the villa!

It is the very top of the hill, which provides maximum privacy, and a good view.

A kitchen with a bar outside under a canopy is a great idea) We spent a lot of time there, in the shade from the sun.

The pool is small, but it is quite enough to cool down)

The house has a tropical style, which I really like in terms of design)

But that's inconvenient.
The smell on the second floor, which creates natural materials on the roof, was too strong for us and we had to sleep most of the nights on the first floor, which of course didn't please us.

And above the bed in the bedroom, in addition to the net, there is a film, which protects you from direct access to poop and urine from geckos, or some other animals living under the roof dome... the feeling is not pleasant when you wake up at night from the sounds of current on the film of liquid...

I really hope that the hosts will somehow be able to resolve these issues in the house and I will gladly come back to this place.

As I have already lived in 5 different houses on the island, and I like this location more than the rest!)

Simply gorgeous! It's hard to put in words how exceptionally beautiful this place is. So much attention to detail. I was curious to see what it actually looks like because the photos were shot with a wide-angled camera, and I thought it might be much smaller than it looks in the photos. But on the contrary. You just have a lot of space, no direct neighbors. The terrace is therefore not visible and tan is guaranteed ;)
You live here outside in harmony with nature, can enjoy wonderful sunsets, cook together. Really great.
Important to mention: The bed meets European standards, so it is nice and comfortable and of high quality (in Thailand there are often extremely hard beds, which are sometimes suitable for a few nights but not for a long-term stay).
The location is ideal in my opinion. It's only about 150 meters to Secret Beach and Silver Beach. It is quite steep, but the sea is also closer from the accommodation than I thought.
There are superbly high class restaurants in the area, whether classic Thai cuisine, real Italians with homemade pastas, vegan burgers and also not far from the Alcove (in my opinion the best restaurant on the island) - a great variety that is appreciated especially for longer stays.
The party zone downstairs in Haad Rin is of course a bit, but if you don't want to party every day now, that's not a problem either. You can get there in about 35 minutes by scooter.
We would move in smoothly if that were possible. 100% recommendation!

Great location!!! Super close to town and the airport, also very easy to get around the area. The beach you stay on has multiple amazing restaurants and bars, its very convenient to go out at night. The water was incredible and very fun to swim in. The place was simple but clean and exactly how it is pictured. Would probably stay here again.

great little beach bungalow in a quiet, off the beaten path location. great access to all the goodies of Maenam and only about five minutes by scooter from Fishermans Village and 15 minutes from Chaweng. two doors down from a little bar for cold beer some life. loved it.

This is the most spectacular place in the island! The bungalow is very cozy has everything that we need it. The location is super calm, not full of tourists but yet close to the main citytown.

Remi all the time was staying with us keep in touch, he helped to organize our meeting in the airport, helped to rent motorbike and car for us for a good price, and every our request was done.
The house is small, but everything what we need was inside.
Wifi was pretty strong. Every day we wake up with sound of waves, not very loud, but very melodic. The view is really awesome. Highly recommend this place!

We cannot recommend this bungalow enough! The location is great as it’s right on a beautiful beach but still quiet. The bungalow itself had everything we needed and you can even use the main area to cook food or make a free coffee. But our favorite part of the stay was the host Kim! She is the kindest and most happy woman. Always there for a talk or recommendations. And she is flexible when it comes to checkin or checkout. We extended our stay for 3 more days and the housekeeper even redid our room and provided us with fresh sheets and towels. You can also have your laundry done by the housekeeper. She did an lovely job and our clothes smelled so good! Got all the stains out!
All in all this was such a lovely experience of an Airbnb stay.

STAY HERE! 👍🏻

My stay with Kim was wonderful. I was warmly welcomed and Kim was a very nice hostess. I felt very good. Everything was close by if you brought something. I recommend the 4 Monkeys Bar, they have great drinks. I would come back to Kim anytime.

An amazing journey, in this little place on the beach at Koh samui, since the beginning to the end. Everything was perfect, one of my favorite air bnb ever.!!
A special thanks to Kim, who has been so nice to us and helpful !

Kim is an absolutely outstanding host. She was so helpful even before I arrived, helping to organise transport before and after my stay. She is so kind and welcoming. The bungalow is adorable and perfectly comfortable and located on the most gorgeous beach. It was such a peaceful and relaxing stay, I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quiet stay on a perfect beach.

The Bungalows are really great, directly located at the beach, you wake up with the morning sun and can enjoy the full nature :-) kims place is really made with love and one of my favourit spots on the island ! Kim is a really nice and heartful person, we had really good coversations and she is always arround or nearby if u are in need of anything. Bang Por is a really good place if u want to have some quiet and relaxing days, everything is nearby ( 7/11, Fruit Shops, Motorbike Rental, and the best restaurant owned by Mr.Doon :-) ) so, if u see this beautiful place is free to book, book it ! I will come back in july again

It was our second time now staying at this beautiful accomodation.
Kim (the host) is a wonderful person and we are very happy to have met her. So friendly and helpful.
If I ever go to Koh Samui again - I will definitely stay there again ☺️🙏

Kim’s place was THE DREAM stay! The bungalows are clean, located right at the beach - you sleep and wake up to the sound and breeze of the sea.

The place is very well maintained in terms of cleanliness and facilities.

Kim is a gracious host that will take care of your every need from tips on what to do, where to eat, to simply chatting with you. Coming back after a long day out always felt like returning home to a warm hug!

I highly recommend this place to anyone that’s looking for peace and a true getaway! I’ll surely be back

Thank you again Kim!

Family owned and operated, Tyler was nothing shy of the perfect host! From the helpful hints and thoughtful touches to our stay, we felt really well taken care of. The food is amazing, as well as massage, and our sea view jungle house was truly unique! Be careful of the monkeys, though! They like to come visit you here (and steal food!) but in Thailand, I wouldn’t want it any other way! Coconut Beach is for all!!

Perfect location on one of the best beaches on Ko Phangan. Tyler and family can't do enough to help and are fantastic. The Jungle House was great for our family but be warned, you will have bugs in the room and will be woken up by monkeys. But hey that is part of the adventure and the view of the sea when you wake up and the awesome beach and food make this a place we will all remember and want to return to.

wi & tyler offer the most beautiful Spot in koh phangan. In the middle of the jungle, we missed nothing, had delicious and homemade food and the most helpful host, we could imagine. thank you for everything, tyler & wi

This is one of the most beautiful places. It is natural and rustic and won't be for everyone, but we loved it. What could be better than being in an open air, white washed villa surrounded by jungle, with a sea view, being woken by wild monkeys? The beach is one of the most beautiful on the island, with powdery white sand, turquoise water and good snorkelling. It is quiet and peaceful, perfect for a romantic getaway or family holiday. Being on the north of the island, it is away from the party scene, which suited us just fine. Wi, Tyler and their family are welcoming, helpful hosts and they work hard to make your stay just as you want it. The menu is simple, but beautifully done and I have to say, the Tom Yum soup was the best I've ever had. We have pretty authentic Thai cuisine in Australia, so that's saying something. After the stress and madness of Covid, it was wonderful to unwind and recharge here and we will definitely be back. This is a one of a kind place. Thank you Wi and Tyler.
John
February 2022
The jungle house was an amazing experiece ! Sleeping with the jungle noises all around us and sharing the terrasse with the monkeys family was great !...
The interior decoration is simple but very nice, and the view on the sea magic...

PS: even if Tyler told us about it, there was indeed quite no mosquitos around ! ...

Staying at the Jungle House was a fantastic experience and a great end of our Thailand experience.
Bettina
January 2022
Our time here was absolutely wonderful. We love the Jungle House and after 14 days we had to extend our stay to enjoy this beautiful place even longer. In total we stayed 23 nights. The open bungalows are really great. Communication with the hosts was great, the food was absolutely delicious. And the beach is fantastic, very clean and the water was wonderfully clear. The colors in this bay overwhelm you again and again. Snorkeling is worth it, we saw lots of fish and schools of fish. Great that you can borrow the snorkeling masks for free.
We also really enjoyed the massages.
Overall we slept in different bungalows. All are unique and cosy. We will miss this great open construction.
The equipment of the bungalows is partly simple but sufficient and very nice and stylish. Here and there a detail could be improved, but the owners know that and always try to implement the suggestions of the guests. Tyler, Wi and the whole family are lovely and always willing to help.
Thank you for the great time, we will definitely be back!

Lovely convenient location out of the main town but walking distance to loads of food options and a convenience store.
Waking up to the sound of the waves felt luxurious.
The bungalow was as advertised. AC and WiFi worked great.
Rachel is an excellent host.

Top notch Airbnb . The pictures don’t do it justice . We had the most amazing time . The hosts Rachel and Stu we’re fantastic. Very kind and communicative. Offered many recommendations for beaches and restaurants on the island . Also they were extremely helpful explaining and setting up our transportation on and off Koh Phangan. Can’t stress enough how amazing the whole experience was from day one. By the last day you will not want to leave . Highly recommend anyone to visit the island and stay in any one of Rachel and Stu’s places !

Rachel and her team were like a family to me ever since I arrived. They answered all my questions promptly, it’s like they never sleep! Rachel makes your stay easy for you by guiding you before you even arrive. She sends you a very well put together list of places to go and things to do and that saves you a lot of time. I really appreciated that because she has great recommendations.
The bungalow itself is squeaky clean with a comfy bed. The ocean views are great (tide was low in the morning when I stayed there but by afternoon it is high again and you can go for a swim) it is very peaceful and I used to sit out on the porch just listening to waves for hours.
There is a 7 eleven only 2 minutes walk from the bungalow and a great cafe (indigo) for light breakfasts (have never tasted a more delicious iced cinnamon coffee 🤤🤤)
Thank you Rachel and team for investing so much TIME and EFFORT into making sure your guests are comfortable and best of all, into anticipating their needs even before they arrive.
I’ll be back again soon and hope I can be lucky enough to book the bungalow again.

Beautiful and fun cabin that fit a family of three easily (two adults and a 7 year old) Lovely to be on the beachfront and listening to the waves at night. Rachel is an amazing host is a brilliant team of staff on hand for anything we needed. Would highly recommend this cabin for anyone wanting a slower pace of holiday. Also plenty of restaurants nearby. Great find!

Absolutely fantastic place! The house was build with details in mind, you got all the amenities you could wish for - most airbnb's just provide the basics but here you really have it all. The view from the patio is incredible, it's just 10m from the sea and at night you can enjoy the ocean sounds. Wonderful! The housekeeping is also perfect, we got changed linen and towels every 3 days.

Overall 10/10 Rating. We loved it!

I stayed at Rachel’s and Stu’s apartment together with my husband for our honeymoon and it was amazing! The apartment is very beautiful, comfortable, clean and you’ll just have everything you need. It’s perfectly located directly at the sea und you have a spectacular view! There are great restaurants and a supermarket close by and you get to all of the beaches very quickly.
Rachel, Stu and Jannis are super friendly and helpful! They provided us with their personal taxi service and even organized laundry and cleaning service in the middle of our stay. Furthermore, they got us a scooter which was delivered and picked up again directly at the apartment. Finally we got a list of recommendations (beaches, restaurants etc.) and all of the places are wonderful! Due to their kind support we could fully lean back and relax.
All in all, if you are looking for an apartment at Ko Pha-ngan, search no more! We highly recommend this place ♥️

Staying in the Boho house was one of the top points of our trip to Thailand, the place is incredible, the view is amazing during the whole day, and even more with the low tide (during the afternoon and night).
The location of the house is perfect, not in the centre and the busiest part but close enough for a 10 minutes ride, and closed to ALL the good beaches you are in the middle of the way to everything. It is also near good restaurants.
Rachel, Stu and Janis are very nice and helpful people, always available for questions and they recommend very good places.
I have no bad things to say.

I will definitely coming back

Awesome ❤️ Rachel & Stu's lil cabin is even cutter than on the photos 😍
The house has such a good energy that we immediately felt like home and we deeply slept from the very first night beside the jet lag 😴
The mattress is very confortable and you get a beautiful view from the bed. There is all the kitchen equipment that you would need, oven, microwave, pans, kettle, ..., and even a blender to prepare fresh fruit juices 😋
The sitting right on the beach is prefect and you can catch pretty nice sunsets 🥰
They give us a list of recommendations that we stuck to and no disappointments, all the spots were great! They were always available and very helpful for any question we had and they made sure we were doing good and enjoying our time. They arranged taxi rides when needed, the laundry washing and the scooter rent.
Well, I highly recommend Rachel & Stu's place.
Rachel & Janis thanks again for everything 🙏🏽 I will definitely come back at yours next time I am around.

This villa was amazing from check-in to check-out. Easy process checking in. They were expecting us and knew us by name. Great management team on-site. Very helpful! The villa was clean with the most beautiful views. The pool was very nice to have. Very private. The restaurant on-site was incredible. Amazing staff, beautiful location with spectacular views and delicious food. I recommend Nats Villa 100%. We spent 10 days over the holidays and what a way to bring in 2022.

This place is AMAZING and is as advertised! The hill everyone is talking about is a workout but it is worth it for the view and accommodations! We didn’t have any problems with cab drivers taking us up the hill either. The place was very clean, the beds were comfortable and they provided plenty of towels. I definitely recommend booking here if you are looking for a quiet and serene vacation. There is security on site and they are very friendly and helpful.

In a great location. However, the check-in time is more later than other places (3.p.m, and unfortunately our case was another 10 mins late).
We expected the cleanliness as the guest needs to pay for the cleaning service for 1,700 THB, but what we found was most of the kitchenwares especially pans were dirty. We had to clean everything before using again. However, the cleanliness of the rooms was ok.

The Aircon in each bedroom are a bit noisy. And the tap in the small room was broken.

Check-out time is 11:00 (again quite earlier than others), but this was a bit more flexible than check-in time.

Host is very nice and quick response.

Beautiful view from the apartment. Every room has a seaview. Excellent location, at a quieter part compared to the main Pattaya beach, less traffic jam too. There's a night market with plenty of food stalls along the beach just a short 3min walk away. Many nice restaurants n cafe within walking distance too. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the water pressure of the taps in the toilets are very low. Other than that it is an excellent place to stay and the host is very responsive to messages. Highly recommend this place especially for big groups.

Loved this space for a family visit! The balcony views are beautiful and the nearby beach is nice and calm. The check-in was a bit awkward but once we figured it out it was fine. There is plenty of living room space and it was very nice to have 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms.

A great place to stay in Pattaya. Very beautiful panoramic scenery for the sunset at Jomtain beach. Easy access, nice staff and large living room.

The image provided in airbnb and the real was kinda similar. When we arrived, there were some trashes in the bin left. We told the owner about that, and the cleaning maid was here to clean in no time. The view is spectacular from above.

The whole place was just so so good for the best spot of sunset! We spent hours appreciating sunset from the corridor and down at the beach just on the opposite site. The place is accurate, very clean and comfy in a very clean/calm location of Jomtien. We had a very good time indeed.

What a fabulous stay here! Nadege and her lovely husband were fantastic settling us in nicely, plenty of advice about the surroundings and the villa. It was a beautiful stay here. the sounds of the waves of an evening made a beautiful sleep possible for us both - I can't recommend this place highly enough and am so pleased to have found it - we will be back! Thank you for having us in your divine, quality-filled and beautiful villa. Simply here to enjoy!

Absolutely perfect stay at this idyllic bungalow ! Nadège was so helpful with every step out of trip, and very quick to respond and to helping us with transfers, ferries, etc. Her recommendations for restaurants, activities and beaches were incredible as well - they totally exceeded our expectations ! Don’t miss sunset at the Alcove, only 5 min walk from the place.

And the bungalow itself is just wow. A pool, sea view, hamac, and so many services / restaurants around !!! Book it now if it’s available:)

A lovely stay right on the beach, close to our favourite restaurants. The bungalows have been recently renovated and everything is supplied. Very comfortable bed and well equipped bathroom with lovely towels.
Our favourite part was the plunge pool - heaven!
Hope to be back again soon.

Very neat and comfortable bungalow with private beach access and really everything you need for a few days off time. Super clean, superb communication before/during/after and Nadege and Damian are among the best hosts we had in some time (we permanently live in Airbnbs). Much appreciate your hospitality and I’m sure we will be back. Thanks a lot for an awesome stay!

Cosy bungalow in the nicest spot of the island. We had many stunning sunsets and were surrounded by nice, walking distance restaurants !
Nadege was extremely friendly and gave us lots of recommendations of where to go and what to do. We would love to come again!

Lovely and comfortable bungalow with amazing ocean view. Close to the other bungalows on the property, but there are only 3 total. Just steps to the ocean! Nadege and Damien were very helpful and responded immediately on (Hidden by Airbnb) for any questions we had.

We had an amazing, unique experience at the Bungalow! The hosts were both very kind and generous with many ideas for things to do around the island.
Valentina
August 2022
This is a Heaven, the stay was perfect. Nadya and Kevin are two wonderful people who welcomed us with great affection. They offer a free pick-up service and on the way to the accommodation they give you information about the island. The house is surrounded by nature and is entirely built in bamboo. Taking a shower outdoors immersed in the jungle was truly fantastic and waking up to the sounds of nature was a unique spectacle. It is truly a place to regenerate and stay and find yourself, completely disconnecting from the outside world.
The location is also excellent, we rode all over the island on motorbike and this is definitely the best part to stay because it is very close to all the clubs of night and it is also on the sunset side.
The hosts give you a kayak and mask and fins for free to use, and they also offer a motorbike rental service at a very low price.
We were very sad to leave this wonderful place, thank you for everything.

Truly one of the best travel experiences we had. What a wonderful stay in the middle of nature (so beware of mosquitos and other adorable ‘guests’). Kevin, Nadya (and Suki) are lovely hosts who made the experience even better. Very welcoming and they provided us with a lot of helpful tips to explore Koh Phangan. The lofts provide everything you need to enjoy your stay and even scooters are provided for a very reasonable price.

A wonderful place with so much character, great facets and a lot of positive energy. The bamboo bungalows are incredibly amazing. l love the natural style, the jungle atmosphere and the closeness to nature that you can feel. And the location is perfect. You can find so much peace and balance here and you are in a very exciting busy part of the island yet. Nadya and Kevin are kind-hearted people and the greatest hosts you can have. I had a wonderful time here.

This place was exactly what we were looking for. It was in a great area, yet there was no noise from the street in the room or by the pool. The room was just right and the pool was so relaxing, clean, and beautiful. It was all topped off with the most communicative and understanding host, Maeg. Thank you so much for letting us stay!

The stay at Maeg’s place was great. The condo was clean, the bed was super comfortable, and the check in process was so easy. The location was perfect for walking to a lot of bars, restaurants, the beach, and a night market. Exactly what we were looking for!! ☺️

I really enjoyed my stay. The condo is conveniently located to many great restaurants and the beach is in easy walking distance. The night market is in walking distance as well. I recommend this place to my friends and would gladly stay here again.

maeg's space was very quiet, clean and comfortable. The security guard who guided us was also very friendly. The condo location was central to Hua Hin and close to all the facilities we wanted. I would like to stay again next time I come to Hua Hin.

The apartment, although small, is perfect for two persons. It is located in a very new nice and new condo, with an awesome pool and fitness room. The apartment is spotless, as well as all the common areas. It is well located, at walking distance to the night market, Hua Hin beach, mall, shops and restaurants. The apartment was extremely clean, and we just loved our stay. The balcony to the pool, was perfect for our breakfasts. Communication with Maeg was always fast and easy, as was the check-in process. Parking is available.
All was perfect, and we will stay again. It was the highlight of our time in Thailand.
Thank you Maeg for providing such nice place.

Modern and comfortable pad in central Hua Hin. Convenient location, as it’s within walking distance to the Hua Hin Night Market, the beach, and a few other attractions. The flat itself is well-maintained and Maeg is extremely responsive if you need any help. Would be happy to stay here again!

Maeg a real SuperHost! We really enjoyed our stay a Maeg's place. Everything was really easy when we arrived (we can check in late at night). The staff at the condominium were super helpful with the check-in process and Maeg was really fast to respond whenever we had any questions. The room was really neat and well equipped with everything we wanted. The condominium's facilities were amazing. The pool looks just like the pictures! It has a great location near Market Village, Night market and 7-11. It’s right in the centre of Hua Hin, which we loved. I would highly recommend staying at this place. It really is value for money.

Khun Maeg is very helpful and responds quickly. The room is well-designed and clean. We love that the project is peaceful even if it is located on a main road. 7-11 and Villa Market are within walking distance.

We had an amazing (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was super easy, our host was accommodating and very quick to respond to our questions. The place was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. The villa looks exactly like it does in the pictures. The location was great as well and only a minute walk down to the beach. I️ would 100% recommend a stay here.

It was great location and beautiful sea view. One of the best Villa I stay in this island. Good communication with owner and manager. But however we had very unpleasant experience with the private chefs at Villa. Over charges us with 2X price of what we booked. Worst part is she is play you like noob and give you many excuses to make you believe she didn’t cheat on you with seafood prices. I believe if you want to stay in this Villa is better to order from online private service and make sure they give you the price before they come over.

Villa was huge and amazing. Right on the water in Samui Bayside villas. Good location for enjoying the island. The management was very helpful in organizing anything we needed i.e. private chef, private boat charters, ATV rides, massages at home ( very good) , transport , golf etc. Villa on 3 levels , stairs a must :) Would definitely recommend to book, a great value for the house. Cash deposit is a must and power is chargeable. Cleaning service provided ever other day. Andrew was very helpful, thank you.
Mod

The villa was great with all the facilities and nice and almost the same view from balcony, facing the sea, from all 4 bedrooms out of 5.

Communications with host are impressive and highly responsive.
Only 1 watch-out was that the electricity was exclusive (they had it mentioned on the description but I believe most people can overlook)

Bonus - They have Sonos sound system for all the villa. Love it!

The good:
a) Beautiful view (Beach and green waters).
b) Beautiful villa (Modern and comfortable).
c) Location (Quiet place but still in easy reach of deliveries and places to go).
d) Great Pool (Water is not cold so you can enter anytime).

The bad:
a) Too much stairs (its 3 floors + garden stairs. Too much up and down for everything)
b) Air conditioning (in the bedroom took from 1 to 2 hours to get cold or even chill. You had to turn on hours before you needed to be in the bedroom)
c) Service is very weak (No one was there to welcome us as she was delayed/ No one was there to help with bags either, no welcome drink, fruits, wet towel, no maid, nothing. I felt like a friend was lending me his villa to use, not that i was paying a lot of money to rent).
d) Little Accident dangerous (A lot of sharp edges, faucet/cut my hand, pool (cut my foot), stairs, etc. Floors are very slippery when wet, and a house with a pool should have that concern. Even the pool stairs is a slippery material.
e) Charged 46 dollars for 2 days of electricity (absurd).

we were a party of 2 families and we had such a wonderful time at the villa. The area is peaceful and the beach was easily accessible. Each room was well appointed and the ensuite bathrooms large. The living/ dining areas were comfortable and allowed us to gather for many movie nights and meals. The team managing the villa were amazing! They were prompt with their responses and meeting all our requests - from restaurant recommendations to diving arrangements. Transportation was not an issue at all.

This is the most amazing villa we've ever rented. The house has a breathtaking ocean view, just a little path behind the house and you are directly at a wonderful bay with crystal clear water. Quiet and relaxing. The villa has an amazing kitchen and we did a lot of cooking. The pool is really big and great for swimming. Also, there is lots of supermarkets, restaurants, and food delivery available. In one sentence: We loved it!

We had an amazing stay at the villa, Sylvie our host was so helpful and quick to assist us with getting bikes, extra blankets, and more! The beach was a short walk away, and the property felt very private. Great outdoor space for games and spending quality time with friends or loved ones. The pool was so nice and refreshing, and each room was well equipped with everything we needed. We will definitely book through Pearl Properties again in the future. :)

The villa is relaxing with a tropical feel about it. There is a slight view of the ocean from the patio.

There is construction happening in the area so unfortunately it will become lest private in the future.

Overall, nice place to stay.

It is a beautiful villa, and very good layout for family as rooms are separated; nice view for the mountain and the sea. Although it is located on the steep slop so its not suitable for elderly and little children. Living room needs to install the air-condition for more conformable and non mosquito living.

If you're looking for a comfy, quiet place to stay in Koh Phangan and plan on renting a scooter/car - this is the place for you. The location is very tranquil, 5min from Mae Haad beach and an easy drive to anywhere else. It is doable without a scooter/car but I'd say a bit more comfortable with. We liked that the villa was all in 1 level (aside from the steps leading to enter), it was clean and we had everything we needed at our disposal (towels, kitchen gear etc). The host, Sylvie, was lovely and very accommodating, with quick replies to any issue or question we had. We traveled as a family with a 1 year old and received a travel cot and a high chair to use during our stay, which was great! Had a very enjoyable and relaxing stay and would recommend the villa :)

Our Stay at the Villa was awesome. Everything was perfect and above our expectations!
The location is perfect, very near to the beach, many restaurants and shops in very close walking distance, but everything still private and quiet.
The Villa is new, in very good condition and extremly good maintained, you will find everything you need inside the living room. Staff is super friendly and always available to help out, if there are questions or if something is needed!
We will definetly consider the beautiful villa for another stay in the future!

The modern designed villa is excellently divided: everyone can be together, everyone has his own seclusion and peace.
Myriam's care is excellent. A (Hidden by Airbnb) group is quickly set up and often solves problems within 10 minutes. Another scooter is needed? A little later there was a scooter. One step solved itself in the rain? The next morning everything was all right. Thank you Myriam for this great service. It made our vacation a dream.
But 100percent luck is rare. So another holiday home is being built above the house. Not only that it was temporarily associated with noise, the invisibility is gone in the future. But Myriam is already working on a solution.
You shall love a hard bed, the beds are pretty hard.
We like to come back to this house. We really enjoyed this functional nice home.

August 2019
This villa is amazing. The bedrooms, the living space but especially the outdoor space are so fancy and up to date. We really enjoyed the relaxed vibe the villa gave to us, but especially the chill vibe our hostes Myriam gave to us! She provided us the best information about the hotspots on the island and arranged us the transportion from the pier and our scooters. Myriam just made everything so easy for us, so we didn’t have to worry about anything during our stay. That is what I call true hospitality and true vacation feeling. Also, I would recommand to rent a scooter with Myriam so you can also explore the island!

The villa is absolutely stunning. Great location, just a 5 minute walk to a beautiful beach. The house was spotless. The three separate suites are great for privacy. The kitchen was well stocked, and a convenience store is located a 2 minute walk away for basic necessities. We saw some of the most spectacular sunsets, while lounging by the pool. Sylvie was extremely responsive and helpful. All around, wonderful stay on the quiet and beautiful side of the island.

August 2018
The house is nicely decorated, very comfortable and well located, with a nice little restaurant just down the street. Personally, we missed the spirit we generally love with AirBnB, because actually you don’t meet the owners, the house is being rented by a third party. Myriam, the agent, has been very reactive and helpful, and at the same time we felt a bit stressed by a complete inventory (with detailed price list in case of damage) just like when you would rent an apartment to live there for a while. It didn’t really feel like a relaxed way to start the holidays - to give an honest feedback. Except from that, everything went all right! Also for families, know there is no dishwasher nor washing machine.
Marcus
August 2018
The beautiful villa is located in a quiet and nice location, only a few min from the beach.
The house itself is wonderful and perfect for a family, with 3 bedrooms in seperate buildings around the pool.
It is mandatory to have scooters or a car, due to the distance to restaurants around.
Myriam was a great host who helped whenever we needed anything.
Great stay!

It's literally in front of the beach, you can jump in the water 3 seconds after you got up! And the host Kim makes sure you are comfortable in every aspect. I also really appreciate the cleanness of the room, and the fresh towels are provided too.
Don't forget to bring mosquito spray or buy it in the pharmacy as it's everywhere in the Samui :)

Kim place was so beautiful. It’s close proximity to the beach is amazing. You can easily walk to several really good restaurants and the 4 Monkeys Bar. It is also a short walk to the 7-Eleven for your basic needs.

My wife and I got married on the beach right outside of the bungalow. Kim can share our pictures if you are interested. It was so beautiful. Kim was easy to work with and was super helpful.

Kim can arrange almost anything for you. Transportation, excursions and provide general recommendations.

Due to its convenient location close to the road, you will hear cars, scooters and emergency vehicles at night. If you are a light sleeper, I recommend ear plugs.

This is one place we will never forget. ❤️

Other recommendations:
4 Monkeys is great for drinks and snacks.
Kathy’s Cafe is great for dinner and late morning breakfast.
Mr. Doons is good for early breakfast and early dinner.

Our week at Kim's place has been nothing but a dream, in a nice functional bungalow right on the beach in front of the bay. Great sunrises and days at the beach were as expected. You can follow every one of Kim's advices, she is totally into making your stay great and confortable: scooter, massages, coco oil, taxis, she made everything very simple. Also, we ate the best lunches at mr doon's place everyday. Hope we come back!!!! Love xoxo

We discovered a gem. We were looking for and found a quiet location situated on a semi private beach with great restaurants- (Thai, seafood and western) just steps away- via the beach. We were able to get car, motor bike rentals and good price on snorkel- hiking tours the the national park with the help of our host - she even arranged to have the best massage lady come to the property! We actually had massages 7 out of 9 days we stayed in the bungalow. From the beach in front of the bungalow we saw sunrise, sunsets and took sea baths daily. Amazing pictures.
No matter what we needed our host was able to help- always available. She made sure the bungalows are clean.
Thé sala-dining area was wonderful to have - meeting other guests and to enjoy meals/appetizers or breakfast looking the calm sea.
This was by far one of the best Airbnb we ever stayed at.
We plan on returning - we will stay with Kim again.

Best Airbnb rental for tropical paradise and most amazing host. Right on the beach bungalow, spotless clean.
I can’t say enough good things about the super attentive host- Kim. She knows so many people arranging events, offering suggestions and even to have amazing private massages on a shady deck listening to the waves and birds. The price of massage is also much better than any outside location. You are walking distance to 7-11 and so many delicious restaurants. Car or motorbike rental, even laundry can also be arranged through Kim.
Sunrises and sunsets are breath taking and perfect photo opportunities. Book here- You will not be disappointed. Peaceful and tranquil. Fisherman’s village is very close too. We extended our stay an extra 5 nights after being here for 2 nights. We thought of going to Phuket but once we realized the jewel this was- we decided to stay.

This is an amazing location for a "get away from it all" beach vacation stay. The unit is very basic, but nothing more is required as you open your door and walk out onto your very own beach! This location is on the quiet side of the island, although you can easily explore the whole island on moped. There are a number of delicious local/very inexpensive restaurants available a short walk down the beach. Finally, Kim is an excellent host who can help you with arranging transportation, recommendations, and pleasant conversation. I would highly recommend a stay here and would be happy to return!

Kim's bungalows are great! stay here. bang po beach is a pretty sleepy place so a great destination if you aim to avoid the crowds. Just because it's sleepy doesn't mean there isn't anywhere to eat or drink though, walk along the beach 10 minutes and you can find a host of nice little restaurants, little beach bars for sunset cocktails or brunch spots to watch the waves come in. Would highly recommend

My boyfriend and I are very impressive to stay here for 2 nights. The room is quite large and seperate section into living room and bed room. Room is clean and beautiful as in the picture show in the application.

There are amenities inside the room such as air conditioner, kitchenware, baby chair, TV, coffee machine, toaster, microwave, hair dryer, refrigerator, iron and water heater.

The most impressive thing to stay here is first aid box that the host prepares to guest in case of there is minor accident occur.

This place provide many facilities to us, example large swimming pool, fitness and car park. There are security guard 24 hours and convenience store (7-11) at G floor. The host is kind and friendly.

I will come back to stay here again and absolutely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Pattaya.

This stay was great. It was clean. Probably the cleanest air BNB we have stayed at. It’s attached to a Movenpick Hotel, so there are plenty of amenities nearby. The views are spectacular, and it is close to all of the family activities in the Pattaya area.

Plenty of good things to say. Master bed and bath are roomy and well appointed. Living room is perfect for a family. The view from the living room and balcony are stunning. Second bedroom and bathroom are quite small, but just fine for kids.

Washing machine is a great perk for slightly longer stays, and going to the beach everyday. There is a cleaning staff that comes daily which is also great.

If you fancy a good steak, check out the T55 Grill at the Movenpick hotel next door.

great place to stay at the beach. Great for families with the pool and facilities at the hotel and residences. A little bit of a drive from Pattaya or Jomtiem beach area. But easy to get to with a car or taxi service. Apartment is as described very clean and had everything you will need to enjoy your stay at the beach.

The location is perfect 5min walk to beach, close to night life, and many restaurants and shopping. The complex feels very modern great views from the pool and lounge on the 31st. The condo was big enough for the three of us. But the floors felt dirty and the bedding was dusty. Overall it was an enjoyable stay. I would stay again. Very good value.

La Casita is the embodiment of a new condominium at the heart of Hua Hin that truly stands out with Spanish-inspired architecture. The multidimensional design of colorful pastels is infused with overtones evocative of the island of Ibiza that lies to the east of Spain and brings to mind its atmosphere of white, sandy beaches gently lapped by crystal clear waters and vivacious parties thronged with the world’s leading celebrities.
The space
The room is 27 sq.m, consisting of studio room with a double bed, a sitting room with a sofa bed, an air conditioner. A bathroom with hot water shower, and a functional kitchenette with a full-size refrigerator, electric stove, microwave and an electric kettle. There's also a full set of dining and kitchen utensils if you fancy cooking yourself, though we would highly recommend dining out at one of the many restaurants nearby.

The condo is a studio, no sitting room, just a chair next to the bed. It is very clean but there are a few maintenance issues that can be easily rectified by the management team. The complex is new and has a very nice swimming pool. Bring your soap.

Description: About this space
Sawadee and welcome to this very private 6 bungalows beach resort hand made and operated by a Thai familly. This place is made for relaxing without the bs of expensive luxury resorts, but it provides real luxury ; Peace, simplicity, no ego. Just chose one bungalow or get a couple for peaceful vacations with friends. Perfect for kids, families, bunch of friends or private retreat. The site structured around a small private beach with nobody but the guests. It’s peaceful. It’s a small paradise
The space
The bungalows are small but big enough for the life on the beach, queen size beds in all bungalows. Some have AC but we never use them as the bungalows have many openings. It’s quiet and simple with full bathrooms and hot water and the water pressure is nice :)

One bungalow is bigger and can accommodate 4 people with a convertible couch, it also has a small private pool to chill out in the sun, very good if you have kids.
Guest access
There is a common place for people to meet and eat,the food is provided by the owner on demand. Fridges are yours to use, as the blenders and microwave oven. It’s an open kitchen where you can be served or cook yourself. Don’t forget that this is a place where people live so common curtesy is required. You will be treated with the same respect you will treat others. Thai people are very proud of their heritage and expect their guests to be respectful of the Thai way of leaving. You will be treated like a real human being. Again, no BS,

A nice place to stay on a small strip of private beach. The bungalows are 10 mins walk into Sri Thanu and you can walk to Zen Beach and others if you don’t want to hire a bike and don’t mind getting hot and sweaty! The breakfast place at the top of the drive is wonderful. I had lovely breakfasts and coffee there every morning! For those that want yoga, Orion healing centre is 10 mins walk away. Two main disappointments were no mosquito nets in the rooms which caused me to be bitten a lot and one night to wake to find a cockroach in my hair!!!! Also, unlike other people who have reviewed here, I didn’t find Wit too helpful. For example when I asked about other beaches to visit, he said ‘I don’t know, I only know here’. Otherwise, a nice quiet spot to stay.

We had a wonderful time at this beautiful place right at the beach. The location is very good, lots of very good restaurants and cool places are very close by. If you want to rent a scooter you should ask them, they over a very good price. The hosts are very nice and very welcoming. Over all we had a great time and would recommend it to everyone.

ITSARA are the perfect place to stay on your trip to Koh Phangnan. Situated on a remote, yet beautiful beach on the west side of the island it is the perfect place to relax and rejuvenate after a day doing yoga or exploring the island. Juney and Wit are also very hospitable and are available to help with any questions or advice that you need. We will definitely be back!

The views are as described and pictured in the listing. The bungalow was very clean. The location was not the best as it’s far away from main towns/beaches (as mentioned in the listing) but they rent out scooters to get around the island. The AC was lacking air flow so it took a long time before bungalow became cool. Overall, we are glad we stayed there.

Description: About this space
Coconut Beach is a private collection of 100% off-grid, modern and stylish bungalows and houses ideally located at beautiful Haad Khom beach on the serene north side of Koh Phangan, and accessible by our private road or boat. WE DO NOT ACCEPT GROUPS OF YOUNG GUYS OR GALS, especially if coming to Koh Phangan for the Full Moon Party. Coconut Beach is proud to be 100% solar powered, and completely off grid (except for the fiber internet) with all water and energy generated onsite.
The space
Guests enjoy the beach front restaurant which makes use of the organic farm onsite, as well as the beachfront massage studio which has one of the best views on the island. Additionally, guests take full advantage of being located at one of the best snorkeling spots in Thailand and directly next to a hidden, unnamed, secret beach.

Our beach front parking, pool, showers, beach umbrellas, motorbikes, paddle boards snorkels and masks and other amenities are all reserved for our guests.

Please check my profile to see our other rooms and reviews at this property.
Other things to note
Our rooms have a unique open windowless design that our guests love. No windows needed, and no air conditioners needed either. Monkeys also love our design and visit often to see if guests left food in the rooms, so guests must be careful to secure food in the rooms.

Due to our modern windowless design, our rooms may be visited by geckos, spiders and other animals from time to time. Due to being off-grid, we may have brief moments without power or internet.,

If you are looking for a quiet retreat style place in paradise this place is for you. One of the best pad Thais on the island! Do expect hills getting to and from the bungalows, anyone less able may not like this.

If there’s a better place to stay Koh Phangan I’ve yet to find it. Amazing beach, amazing hosts, lovely bungalow, it really is a prefect place to come and unwind for a while!

Really the best air bnb we have ever stayed at. The room is beautifully decorated and set out immersed in the jungle surrounded by nature, monkeys and the sound of the ocean 🙌 the Hosts Tyler and Wii are amazing, so friendly and welcoming. We have been gone a few hours and miss it already 🌿🌱🌴🍃🌴🌿

If you are looking for nature and peace, this is the right place for you! The bungalows are a dream you are in the middle of nature. The beach is lovely and the owners really really nice and helpful. We immediately fell in love with this place. The dog named Pookie (Black) is super sweet and has been with us all the time we miss her already!

We had an amazing stay at Tyler and Wi’s place! The location is just the best place to be on Koh Phagnan if you want to have a peaceful moment surrounded by nature! Wi makes the best Pad Thai and banana pancakes on the island!!! If you have the time to speak with Tyler, you could enjoy great chats and learnings about the Island and the culture!

We had a gecko sleeping with us (which was great because he protected us from insects😅, no need to be scared of those once even though they might be impressive, they are nice!).

Thank you Wi and Tyler !! We will for sure come back to yours during our next trip in Thailand!

Description: About this space
The bungalow is located in the most beautiful and quiet part of the island, Haad Salad, the whole bungalow is protected from those little mosquitoes, there are nets on each window, the room has a very nice spirit and you can hear the birds while you're enjoying your time on the balcony. Its situated around the amazing nature, a lot of coconut trees, banana trees and amazing flowers, its 3min walk to Haad Salad beach.
The space
The view is amazing, the balcony will be your favourite spot to chill on the Thai cushion, read a book or enjoy your meal while listening the amazing bird songs. Your bungalow is located in a vibrant area surrounded by Trees, Flowers, Bananas and Papayas. The nice balcony can serve as your office! Once you go in the bungalow you will feel that it's like a little home, nice comfortable double bed, getting the fresh air all around the house, all the time. You will have a very good equipped kitchen: fridge, freezer, stove (gas), toaster, cutlery, pans and other useful supplies for a healthy lifestyle, where you can cook some delicious food or prepare your morning coffee or tea. There is a wooden clothes rack and a small bamboo table. Basic bathroom, but very fresh from the nice plants that will make your showers more magical, and a huge mirror. The lights are enjoyment at night, they make the night much more fun.
Guest access
Enjoy everything around!
Other things to note
There are a few stairs to clim to get to the bungalows, they all have the sea view but because of the trees sometimes you see it sometimes you don’t! Hopefully you will enjoy the sea view through the trees!,

I came here expecting a bit more. There was no air conditioning, which is my fault for not checking. Still, the place isn't worth the price. There are a ton of resorts offering similar prices with way more features. While the host themselves were pretty nice and check in wasn't too difficult, I just expected more. I left within 2 hours to find a better place to stay, it was literally just too hot. The resort I went to cost less, had a pool, and ocean view for same price. To be fair the host was adaptable in letting me change the dates prior to actually booking. S/he didn't have to do that.

We stayed one week in here with my friend and we loved it. The place is really calm and nice. Owners were great and bungalow was very clean, totally worth of the price. Located near to salad beach, for me the best part of the Island. Supermarket and most of the restaurants are a bit far by walk but there are many scooter rental places nearby. Thank you Rose!

Would wholeheartedly recommend this bungalow! Situated on a hill amongst many fragrant flowers and trees, it’s a great place to reconnect to nature and enjoy a simple way of life. The space is decorated nicely with Thai cushions inside and out, batiks, bamboo shelving and mood lighting that really set the vibe and make you feel at home. Many windows that let in plenty of light + fresh air and yet fortunately no bugs. The outdoor patio is the best, perfect for enjoying the songs of the birds and evening breezes. The host , Eugenios , goes above and beyond. You’ll be in great hands. Anything you need or any questions and he’s available. Many Thanks! 🙏

Evgеnios was friendly and helped in everything that I asked. I liked to stay in a bungalow in the vicinity of nature. it was clean, bed was comfortable and there were many useful things. In the kitchen there is enough space for cooking and on the terrace cool to relax or work. Location is good, 3 mins from the beach and not far from shops/restaurants. There is no air conditioning, but there is a fan. The bungalow is located not far from the road so in the daytime you can hear noise from the road and the restaurant, but not much. I could recommend this place.

We had a wonderful stay at this cute bungalow. There are so many sweet details and it really makes you feel at home. It was in walking distance to great restaurants and near the beach ( the sunsets were beautiful). Evgenios was really nice and gave us great information about the island and what we can do. Thanks to him we got to see a sweet little night market in the north of the island. It had a great vibe and plenty of delicious food. We can really recommend this bungalow!

One of the best airbnb experience in my life. Everything was perfect for me.

The location : quite, unique, surrounded by nature. Great restaurants just in front, and shops not far. Easy access to the best beach of the island ‘haad salad’ 🌴

Hospitality: Ivenios is a really nice person. He’s helpful and give really good advices. He knows the island very well and take good care of his guests.

The bungalow: I loved it !
Exactly like the pictures. Very clean and charming. All the well thought details made the atmosphere of the space so nice.

I highly recommend rose Bungalows for your stay. You’ll adore it !

I made the mistake to book only 4 nights and then it was fully booked but I’ll definitely come back.

Thank you.

Alistair’s beach house was perfect in every way. Great location on the best swimming beach on Samui. The house was very clean, comfortable, and well stocked, and having a cleaning crew every 4 days was a nice bonus. HIGHLY recommended!

November 2021
Let’s start with the great things about this property first. Alastair the host and his partner Kwan with her partner Mike are outstanding and we will be friends with Kwan and Mike for the rest of our lives. The property is on the beach and the views are amazing. The A/C units, Wifi, kitchen, dishes and cookware are all great. The showers have hot water and the bed is super comfortable. They will clean the villa every 3 days and change the bedding and towels. Chol and her husband rake the beach and pick up garbage, she will also be the one to clean the villa, she is so kind and works extremely hard.

Now the things to take note of but are of no fault to the owners. The entrance to the villas are off the main road you will enter on a dirt path leading past a few local homes and into the jungle leading to a walking bridge over a river where you will park and in order to get to the villas you will walk over the bridge over the river, takes a little getting used to.

The villas are located inside of sort of an island because the river drains into the sea on the right and left 1/4 mile each way so when raining or high tide the river water mixes with the sea water making it rather dirty and not so clear.

Ants and mosquitoes are quite abundant in Thailand so you need to spray daily for the ants and always use mosquito repellent when out.

Box Jelly fish are of concern in Koh Samui during rainy season and the local hospitals do not have the anti venom if stung so buy vinegar it could save your life.

You will need a rental car, motorbike, or taxi to leave the villa, you can walk out to the main road through the jungle or walk along the beach where you can get to a local street but you must actually walk through the river if you go this route.

Moonrakers is an amazing property with amazing views for a price you will not find anywhere else based on its location right on the beach.

5/5 for this beautiful beach front place. Direct access to the sea! All the amenities you need for a relaxing time. Angela’s restaurant is a 20 second walk and does the second best roast dinner in the world (mum first). Alastair is a top guy and handles any queries in minutes. Would highly recommend for a spacious and relaxing time on a quiet beach in paradise.

Needless to say, it's the best Airbnb experience ever. Good location, easy communications, they put their heart into his place as well. Will come back again next year.

There are no words sufficient to describe the exquisite perfection of Villa Tsay. Irene and Yan are hosts who meet the highest standards. Whatever the criteria for a SuperHost, they undoubtedly meet them, even if the title has not yet been conferred. The reservation and communication processes prior to arrival were easy and thorough. We had tips and tricks about the island itself and options for ferry and plane travel to get there. Irene met us at the ferry dock and walked us over to the car rental she had prearranged for us. She later arranged for us to exchange the rental vehicle for a scooter. The villa itself is without a doubt the most beautiful villa in which we have stayed. The only problem with saying it matches the pictures is that they do not do justice to its beauty. And, the VIEW! The sunsets from the infinity pool were the things of which dreams are made. The two 90-minute massages (again arranged by Irene) poolside were life changing. Want dine beach side? No shortage of amazing places to do so. Want to eat in? No problem. The on-call staff member (Kjaw) was always a phone call away. Fill out the menu and he hops on his scooter and brings you anything you need. Did I mention that Kjaw is amazing? All in all, this was the villa, island, and trip of which dreams are made. We are forever grateful to Irene and Yan (and Kjaw) for the privilege of experiencing Villa Tsay and Koh Phangan!

The villa is beautiful located high up on a mountain. The photos are extremely accurate in depicted the space. The pool is really lovely and quite large with a perfect spot to take in the magnificent sunsets. Irene was available 24/7 to answer any questions and assist with any accommodation we could ask. She advised us to rent a vehicle which was a great idea as the villa is quite difficult to access and taxis will not drive up the steep drive. All in all it was a wonderful stay and we look forward to returning in years to come.

Villa Tsay is a place you will never want to leave! Went in with high expectations and it was better than expected. The pictures are great, and still do not do it justice. The Villa is more spacious than expected, yet completely private from neighbors. The infinity pool and views are incredible. The space was stocked with everything from towels and shampoo to silverware and champagne.

In addition to a beautiful villa, Irene & Yan were very gracious hosts that provided the perfect experience for our honeymoon. They took care of every little detail from arranging transportation upon arrival in Ko Samui to coordinating several activities that were first class experiences due to the good relationships they have with other local businesses.

Haad Yao is nice quiet town with a bunch of beachside bars and restaurants. The villa is only a 10 min walk to beach and is very safe at night.

Can’t say enough about how great of an experience we had, would highly recommend it.
Claire

Absolute perfection! I can’t say enough good things about Villa TSAY. It was the most amazing place to relax as a family. The location is great - just up the hill from beautiful Haad Yao beach. The hill is very steep, but that means the views out to sea are incredible.

Our boys (aged 11 & 12) loved the games room; the pool is stunning, and the accommodation is pure luxury. We can’t wait to return.

Don’t hesitate to book this place - it’s totally worth it!

Stunning villa, incredible views. The space has been designed to slot into the island seamlessly and we felt as though we were surrounded by nature for a week of peace!

Only note would be the hill which was mentioned before we booked, but it is so steep, we saw it as a bonus as we were able to walk off dinner each night but worth noting it is very steep!

We loved our stay!
Damian
June 2019
The villa is simply incredible. Everything was just perfect. Irene took very very good care of us. She left us completely to ourselves, unless we needed something, then she took care that no wish remained unanswered. What can I say, we had just the perfect stay. Many many thanks, kop khun krap.

We have just returned home from 10 days at Villa Tsay. What a wonderful house in a perfect location. It was all that we had hoped for and more. Irene & Yan were the perfect hosts; attentive, considerate, always available for help or advice. The villa was maintained quietly but conscientiously. We could not have asked for more. Thank you Irene and Yan and we hope to see you in Sydney if you ever travel this way

Realt Nice place

Go for this apartment if you are looking to get scammed by the glamorised photos of the rooftop swimming pool.

The host hid the fact from us that the pool is non-functional and used the photos as a bait to lure not just us, but many more guests.

Nothing in the apartment was worthy of the price that we paid for it, only to leave disappointed with my family. The only decent thing was the views from the balcony and master bedroom.

Outside apartment door stinks of seafood (maybe there's a cold storage nearby). It was barely clean and hygienic, hair of the previous guests could be found on the bathroom floor.

Last but not the least, the second room is barely big enough to accommodate only a damn bed, let alone your luggage or anything else.

Conclusively, if you're opting for this place solely because of the steamy hot rooftop infinity pool photos, don't!

The host is lying because there was no swimming pool even if the announcement said they were 2 including one on the rooftop. In addition to that he kept coming into our apartment.
To conclude it’s forbidden to rent on Airbnb in this residence so the host is doing it illegally.
You shouldn’t take this apartment.

This was a fantastic stay! The condo looks just like the photos. Very well taken care of, beautifully decorated, clean and in a great location. Bee is such a responsive host and communicates quickly and clearly. Extremely thoughtful.
Spent 3 weeks here in Pattaya. Great location in walking distance to the beach and easy access to many eateries, Central Festival(Biggest mall in pattaya), Starbucks, big supermarket, soi Buakao are within walking distance(3~5min), and Walking street is 5 min by Grab.
Thank you so much hosting us at this special occasion!
Before we didn’t realize there are 2 types of 1-bed rooms at the base central condo, last time we stayed at a smaller room without knowing, and much more expensive too… most of 1-bed rooms are 30sqm, no balcony unlike this one. We enjoyed seaview from the room and the balcony and spacious and beautiful living room watching Neflix. The room is high up and had great view of the bay, room is divided in 4 function from living room, bedroom, toilet and kitchen. We went to the roof top pool by walk too and it’s spectacular view.

The room is perfect and thank god I can find such a perfect accommodation for this trip. Bee's photos about the house accurately show every detail. You can confidently make your decision based on the photos. The big room is well furnitured and very clean. Bee has provided you most things you need for a long-term trip, If you live here, you can have a 5-mins walk to the biggest shopping mall in Pattaya, everything you need and want to eat could be found there. Standing on the balcony, you can have a whole view of the ocean, wonderful scenery! In addition, the BASE has the best infinity pool in Pattaya, you must try it!

As a host, when we first stumbled upon this listing on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. BM is the most thoughtful, gracious host.

As a guest, the room was with a billion-dollar sea view, we weren’t morning persons however we’ve gotten to wake up at 6 am to enjoy the greetings of sunrise, it’s worth waking up to ..

Most recommend for this spectacular Condominium !

Super of super host ..

The Condo was perfect we loved everything about it .High floor overlooking the Gulf of Thailand with incredible sunsets every evening.
The balcony was very big and comfortable.
The pool was the biggest & very best we have ever we used in multiple trips to Thailand and we used it everyday.
The private beach was great quiet & clean .
We had a couple of small issues over a month we stayed and they were dealt with immediately always with a smile and excellent service. Staff were very accommodating.
The building is a little out of the main part of the city which was a plus for us
more laidback & quiet .
Stores & a couple of great restaurants within walking distance .
We are already planning our return.

Renate was very available and quick in giving all information we need. The house and swimmingpool are situated in a beautyfull garden.
Juste near of the habitation there is a very good restaurant with many choice and another near the beach with less choice. Both are very good for eating end take-away.

We had a wonderfull time with our family there thanks to Renate and the house. Thanks to here.

Originally booked to stay for 6 weeks, we extended our stay because we loved it so much; a beautiful, quiet corner of Samui away from the backpackers and touristy area with tranquil beaches and gorgeous views.

Renate was amazing from start to finish. She met us at the house when we arrived, and was really helpful when we had questions. overall a really lovely experience.

The grounds are lush, the pool is large and clean, we practically had it to ourselves every day and we had water delivered right to the house every week

Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a more quiet, relaxed stay on Samui. (it's a 300 baht cab to anywhere - approx. 10km, though but the island is relatively cheap so we didn't mind)

Check out the cutest beach bar just up the beach @Hug Samui, too. Papaya Salad to die for!

We stayed in the house with our 2 kids 2 and 8 months old. Plus had some visitors at the time. We loved the complex to bits! The pool is directly at the beach and you get in touch with other people living in the complex easily. The house is super equipped what we loved having 2 little kids with us. Renate is a lovely host being there for you whenever you need her or any suggestions or Tipps regarding things to do, renting a car or whatever you need.
Bang Por Beach is just perfect for families. It never gets odd cuz there r plenty of possibilities to do with the kids on the island. You easily get around either renting a car, taking a taxi or one of the pick ups. We loved it so much that we decided to stay another month at Bang por. Renate helped us finding another house to stay at because the one we rented for the first month was already booked for the time after. We can recommend it for everyone either for families or just couples. There are tones of possibilities to go out for food and drinks just around the corner. Bang por has really nice restaurants for little money.
The house was really clean too plus the ladies cleaning it are just angels. Everyone is super friendly. We‘d always love to come back!! Thanks again Renate!!

This is our third trip to this part of Koh Samui and Renate's place was perfect for us. She met us at the entrance and showed us where to park and get access to the house as well as showed us around the house. The generous welcome packet on the bar and in the fridge was indeed most welcome. Renate was very responsive when, for example, the air conditioner needed servicing, and she was ready to give us tips on what to see and do. We had a great time in a very nice house.
Response from Renate

Glad you had a good time and thanks for your visit and review.
Hope we can see you again here soon

perfect place, perfect house and decoration.
Renate makes you feel welcome, definitely a place I'd recommand. We were there for 6 days with our 3 teenagers, and all was perfect.

We had a fantastic family holiday at coconut Sands. We would highly recommend anyone looking for a relaxed, easy, family-friendly experience. the house was perfect for us (too big!), the property was safe, well-kept and peaceful. Being right on the beach, you are so close to everything you need such as great restaurants on the beach. Renate was a great host and made our stay very easy. We are already planning our trip back!

We had a wonderful week at the Villa. It's a beautiful setting and the pictures show exactly what you are getting which I liked. Renate was very warm and welcoming in her dealings with us and was happy to offer advice/guidance where needed.
Cleaners came in regularly which was lovely and a very reliable taxi and laundry service were suggested.

Excellent service, beautiful and spacious house in Thai style,clean rooms. It was everything what you need during vacations. Wonderful garden arround with beautiful plants. The sea with amazing beach was near. Practically few steps from our house was swimming pool with a view of a sea. In the beach you can find a few bars, massage. Comfortable place for living.Really we were so happy and i recommend every one to go there.

10/10 :-) We really enjoyed our stay at Coconut Sands. The villa was beautiful, even better in real life than it looked in the pictures. Fully stocked with all you could want. Lovely peaceful area, few bars and restaurants and massage places within walking distance that offer everything you'd need. Lovely well kept gardens and pool area and a stones throw from the beautiful beach. Renate was a great host, helpful and knowledgeable and quick to get back to us whenever we had any questions. A local lady Mrs Chin came to the villa and cooked for us one night, this is something I'd definitely recommend you to do if you were to stay here, her business card was up on the pin board in the kitchen. The only warning is I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is scared of dogs, as there are quite a few wild dogs roaming the complex but all are very friendly but not overly so, and we enjoyed regular visits from a cute puppy who'd come looking for crumbs after breakfast each day! Fantastic holiday and would definitely stay here again. Thanks Renate!

A week in paradise? Absolutely. So much so, we want to book to come back in the next six months. Renate was a delightful host, arranging everything for our stay from airport pick up to recommendations on restaurants, local markets, best beaches, even a hairdresser! Nothing was a problem, the house was simply perfect.

Set back slightly from the beach, the villa is contained within a small group (approx. 6 villas) in private gardens that face the beach. With a shared swimming pool that no one else apart from us seemed to use, a restaurant with fantastic food and take away service so we could eat on our balcony & local bars along the beach, we wanted for absolutely nothing during our stay. If you are looking for a quiet, secluded peaceful holiday away from the tourist hotspots & clubs of Chaweng then this is definitely for you. We hired a scooter for the week at minimal cost which allowed us to further explore the island and the local area. Despite both being regulars to Samui we agreed that this accommodation couldn't be topped for what we were after. Solitude, peace and relaxation were the key words to summarise our experience this time in Samui. We can't wait to come back and can't thank Renate enough for looking after us so well.

The villa is located in a small but fine complex directly on the beach. The entire complex is very well maintained,clean and quiet. The villa is a Thai house. It never really gets cool despite the air conditioning. The villa is very well equipped and the cleaning staff works very accurately and attentively. The communication with Renate was great. She responds within the shortest possible time and there was a problem, this was fixed the same day!(air conditioning, light bulb change) The pool is beautiful and very well maintained. There is a children's area, which we very much appreciate with three children. The 7/11 supermarket is about a 10-15 minute walk. A car or taxi is advisable,because Big C and other larger shopping facilities are too far away. The beach is very idyllic, the sea is only suitable for swimming in places. We enjoyed our stay and can highly recommend it, especially for families seeking peace and quiet.

Дом с шикарным видом!!!

Обычно мы читаем отзывы и на основании отзывов, фото и описания выбираем жильё. Но этот дом был без отзывов. Прочитали описание и посмотрели фото к этому дому и рискнули приехать без отзывов. Но, к нашему огромному разочарованию, дом не соответствует фото (на фото комнаты выглядят больше, как будто вытянуты ) и описанию.

В описании дом должен быть с бассейном, но, на момент нашего пребывания, бассейн находился в стадии строительства. Мы попросили хозяина прекратить стройку на момент нашего пребывания. Спасибо ему за это большое, тут же рабочие ушли.
Wi-Fi тоже не работал или его не было, не поняли, но хозяин и здесь оперативно отреагировал: на следующий день пришли люди и сделали Wi-Fi : отлично работает !!!
Вход в дом, как будто, тоже не закончен.

На фото 2 спальни с шикарнейшим
видом, но по факту, одна из спален совсем по-другому выглядит: с 2 очень маленькими окнами, упирающимися в скалу.
В описании указано, что эта вилла совершенно новая, со множеством дополнительных услуг, с уборкой, с шезлонгом , бассейном, феном, барбекю, вилла уже полностью оборудована, вам просто нужно прийти и насладиться.
Нет, к нашему сожалению, это не так, ничего из выше перечисленного нет!
Диван далеко не кожаный, как написано, он с желтыми пятнами, разводами .

В описании указано, что Здесь также есть большой обеденный стол и полностью оборудованная кухня в западном стиле. Не так ! Посуды не хватает : вилок 3 шт, не было сковороды и кастрюли ( сковороду хозяин принёс, кастрюлю и вилку так и не дождались), кастрюлю сами купили, чашек для чая не хватает , чайник не работает…
Еще в описании указано , жильё недавно сдаётся в аренду (ну, это возможно), все современное и чистое (это не так!) про чистоту , однозначно не так!!!
Зачем то ещё написано про бесплатную ежедневную бутылку воды, конечно же и ее нет.
Душ, в одной из ванных комнат, без холодной воды. Про воду сказали хозяину, на это он задал вопрос : «Это ваш первый дом в Тайланде?»))))
Это далеко не первый наш дом в Тайланде, мы часто здесь бываем и длительно. Очень любим Тай ! Но такой дом у нас первый ))).
Хотели уехать сразу же как приехали, но не было свободных домов.

Description: About this space
My place is right on a secluded beach. You’ll love it because the large windows and glass doors give you excellent beach, ocean and island views. If you love bicycling, kayaking or quiet walks on a long beach with hardly anyone else in sight then look no further.
The space
Our place is on a secluded 4km long white sand beach. The more than 40 islands just off shore are great for snorkeling. You can do this by kayaking on one of our two kayaks (free) or by hiring a fishing boat to take you around. The area is great for cycling as there is very little traffic and roads are very good. We have a couple if bicycles at the house which you are welcome to use for free. There are many view points, temples, beaches and parks to explore within 10kms of our place.
Guest access
You have the entire house along with a 2000 square meter property to yourself. This includes 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, living room and dining room.,

My husband & I plus our 2 small dogs stayed here for several weeks. We thoroughly enjoyed our time and so did the dogs. The beach house was as the name implies RIGHT on the beach, such beautiful views all the time. And the sound of the ocean lulls you to sleep. There were so many thoughtful touches throughout the entire house, and Chris & Areeya even provide a manual for you that gives you information on the house and where to locate things, restaurants, and lots of things to do. So helpful! They even provided a kayak and bicycles!!! They met us upon arrival and showed us everything we needed to know for our stay. Also, they were very responsive if we had any questions throughout our stay. It was very quiet and peaceful at their house and the beach in front of the house, a very relaxing vacation. We would not hesitant to stay here again if we are ever in the area. Thank you Chris and Areeya for a wonderful vacation!

This was a wonderful stay and as advertised. Prior to arrival, Areeya and Chris were quick with accurate and helpful communications. Also, the handover was easy as both were at the home upon arrival. Everything was spotless which was appreciated. The area was remote and quiet which was exactly what we sought for our holiday. Everything worked properly and we did not have any problems. When returning to Chumphon, this house will be the top choice on our list.

If you want privacy and spend a good time with friends or family I recommend this. Peaceful, safe, private and most importantly, the atmosphere is very good. The landlord is attentive and friendly. There's also a manual on how to use the house look very professional.

Great place to spend some time right on the beach in a fantastic location. Chris and Areeya are superb hosts who are very communicative and supportive to help make the stay as good as possible. The house has everything we needed and is very comfortable, nice cooking facilities, clean, and looks straight out onto the water.

We had an amazing week at Hidden Holiday Beach House! The house is well equipped with everything you could need, the beach views from every room was amazing, and Chris was wonderful. He gave loads of local tips and information. The beach was empty all week, so it really felt very private. Sand fleas were on the beach during our stay, but bug spray helped. The property isn’t sand, so you can sit less than 5ft away from the beach and they don’t bother you. Highly highly Recommend this place!
Piranaj
August 2020
We loved Chris' place. It was spacious and comfy, bearing all necessary comforts for a great stay. We loved having a washing machine to wash our clothes after playing in the sea every day. The kitchen is very well equipped. There is even a drinking water filtration system, so you don't need to buy in drinking water. We loved kayaking in the sea, though we didn't make it to the islands in front of the house.
The house is pretty isolated which was exactly what we loved so much about it, but i would highly recommend that you have a means of transportation to be able to get around. There are a couple of bikes with handy saddlebags that you can use to get around the area.
Areeya was very attentive to our needs, making sure that we had everything we needed, giving us great recommendations, and especially making sure that we prevent ourselves from the sandflies on the beach.
The highlights of our stay were the snorkeling trips we took on a fisherman's boat upon Areeya's recommendation. During this COVID period, it was magic. We had the sea to ourselves and were able to really take our time and enjoy the corals and fish. We will definitely go back again when we can.

perfect accommodation, lovely location, the whole area is very quiet, on the beach and all over the gulf it was just the two of us, half an hour's drive from the center of Chumphon for shopping center and more, possibility of day trips to the nearby islands in front to the house, everything perfect, only negative note the beach in front of the house, not clean because it is public.

- Incredible view
- Very nicely maintained pool
- Very well equipped kitchen (had appliances)
- Their services are outstanding! They took care of booking ferries, taxis for transfer, experiences like snorkeling etc.
- Super responsive. They respond very quickly on (Hidden by Airbnb) and speak English well. Communicating was super easy because of this.
- The drive up is very very steep. It was a mild irritant but the view was worth it. One person can take the bike up. Doing it with a passenger is probably not possible

Amazing!

I’ve stayed in many places and I am honestly struggling to think of somewhere better.

The villa is great and the view is fantastic. I was able to work from the villa and enjoy Koh Tao whenever I didn’t have meetings.

Highly recommended.

I loved everything from the villa, inside and outside. The view from the swimming pool is unbeatable.

Photos didn’t do this place justice. It’s a breathtaking view. They had a supplied cellphone with the numbers for cabs and restaurants that came with the room. We had plans on koh Tao and cancelled them all to stay in the villa every minute we could. Highly recommend. They won’t disappoint

This place was the perfect escape for my boyfriend and I! The pictures simply do not capture the breathtaking view. The luxury of having a private pool makes it worth the price. The villa is quite secluded from the town but if you are comfortable with riding a motorbike it’s only about a 5 minute drive downhill. The staff was very helpful when we had questions.

A fantastic location next to Central Festival shopping mall on 2nd Road. Rooms are very large with good air con, beds and showers. Some rooms have a washing machine otherwise there are self-service machines on level 3 or the laundry services on the street (e.g. Soi Honey).
Staff at reception are pleasant and helpful and Honeys also operates a coffee shop and laundry service on level 3.
Rooms will have a balcony that offer a sea view north or south (towards Walking Street). Both are good provided you are above the 12th floor.
The lift lobby is manned by security 24/7 and guests just need to provide ID. Residents don't.
On one occasion the room above me was undergoing renovation and Honeys kindly moved me without question.
I would stay again without a worry.

My friends and I stayed a Baan Leelawadi for 5 nights and had an absolutely superb experience, the villa is located right on Bophut Beach, and is really close to all the restaurants at Fisherman’s Village. The villa staff headed by Ae and her team go and do what is necessary to keep the guests happy and their personalised touch is present everywhere. Would be delighted to be back at Baan Leelawadi in the near future again.

The place has a great view and is in a central location easy walk to all attractions. But is a little run down some furniture needs to be replaced. Cleaning is performed only one time per week so dont be too messy. Also dont leave any food or trash out or the ants will attack. The staff was nice and friendly and did there best and I appreciated their help.

Amazing location and house. Good aircon in the bedrooms and shower was big! Right by the beach and close enough to walk into the village. Sima was so helpful and collected us and dropped us back to the ferry pier. Can highly recommend and we’d definitely stay again if we come back!

Das Ferienhaus ist sehr schön und über die kleine Brücke über den Fluss ist man sehr schnell am Strand. Das Haus ist ruhig gelegen und man kann die Tiere drum herum hören. Zu Fuß kann man in ca. 5 bis 10 Minuten am Strand entlang ins Dorf laufen, wo es jede Menge Restaurants und auch zwei Einkaufsläden und Obststände gibt. Die Gegend ist nicht so touristisch wie der Süden der Insel, was uns sehr gut gefallen hat. Man ist etwas ab vom Schuss, kann aber schöne Wanderungen und Strandtage von dort aus unternehmen und sich bei Bedarf einen Roller Mieten und den Rest der Insel erkunden. Sima ist eine sehr sehr nette Gastgeberin. Bei Fragen hat sie uns immer weiter geholfen und uns auch oft ihre Hilfe angeboten und wertvolle Tipps gegeben. Sie hat uns auch vom Pier abgeholt und wieder hingebracht (für eine kleine Gebühr). Wir haben die Zeit dort sehr genossen und können die Unkerkunft nur weiter empfehlen.

Amazing location! Close to everything, but just far enough away to cut down on the noise. Benzi was very prompt and patient with me during the check in process. Everything was outlined in his listing, but I neglected to read thoroughly (my fault). He was accommodating with any questions I had. 24 hour security is a nice touch. They are very courteous and make the condos feel secure. Would choose Benzi and his property during future visits.

A big balcony can serve as your office, yoga studio or spacious terrace to read a book or have dinner and drinks with friends. A big hammock is available for powernapping and other lazy activities. A little walk of 500m brings you to the nearest beach Haad Salad, where you can spend your time sipping coolness from a fresh cold coconut!
The space
A few steps from the parking brings you onto the terrace which is furnished with a table (for laptops, plates, drinks, games, books), some chairs, a hammock and a little jungle of plants and flowers. The main room is very spacious (high ceiling) and comes with a king size bed for sleeping, a wooden cabinet and hanging space for clothing and some shelves for other personal belongings. There are lights for both practical situations (white and bright) and romantic moments (little lamps and candles). From the main area, the left door brings you into the kitchen. This is a sunny room with a big window and outdoor sink-counter, which makes washing dishes a pleasure. You will find the kitchen fully equipped with a fridge, freezer, stove (gas), toaster, cutlery, pans, kettle and other useful supplies for a healthy lifestyle. The left door goes into the bathroom. You find a shower with hot water, a basic sink with mirror and another plant for both oxigen and color. You have some shelves and points to hang your towels, clothing and toiletries.,

the bungalow is as the photos. What you don't know is that there is a bit of jungle back and on the sides which is really great because you can hear birds. You have no neighbours next to you! The view is amazing... Just a few steps to get up to the house, but it's ok. And you're just 4 minutes walk to beach salad. We loved it

Evgenios was really helpful with recommendations and available to answer questions, the accomodation is in a lovely area and with scooter/bike super easy to get around other areas of the island. Perfect spot for getting to Koh Ma, the Village Green and port when necessary. Clean place with kitchen amenities for making coffee in the morning and stocking beer in the evening. Lovely view and privacy, thanks for a lovely stay we will definitely be back!

Wir hatten eine sehr gute Zeit bei Evgenios. Das Häuschen steht mitten im Grünen und man hat einen tollen Blick auf die Bucht. Die Ausstattung ist einfach aber es ist alles da was man braucht .Die anfängliche Sorge die unterhalb liegenden Straße könne zu laut sein ist bei uns nicht eingetreten. Gegenüber liegt das Restaurant von Dah,die beste Köchin der Insel. Ausserdem betreibt sie einen Taxiservice den man jederzeit in Anspruch nehmen kann. Generell sollte man sich einen Scooter mieten um die Insel erkunden zu können.
Die Kommunikation mit Evgenios hat super geklappt. Er hat immer gleich geantwortet und wenn wir etwas brauchten hat er sich sofort darum gekümmert. Wer einen ruhigen entspannten Urlaub geniessen möchte im typischen Ko Phangan-Inselstyle ist hier genau richtig. Ich würde jederzeit wiederkommen!

Понравилось местоположение дома. Он находится выше остальных стоящих поблизости и мы получили желанную уединённость. Именно в этом доме, самый удачный вид с террасы. До пляжа идти около 3х минут. Сам район тихий и не людный. Поблизости есть ещё несколько пляжей. Хозяин помогал во всем, даже заказывал для нас товары из интернета и помог с покупкой слинга для ребенка 2-х лет, чтобы ездить на скутере. Дом новый и чистый, что нас очень порадовало, особенно с учётом того, что мы отдыхали с двумя маленькими детьми. В 30 секундах хотьбы, магазин и кафе. В кафе хорошее меню, большой выбор и не дорого. Там же можно арендовать байк. В магазине тоже не дорого, не сильно отличается от цен в супермаркете. По объявлению, бывает сложно понять, что ты получишь в итоге. Мы считаем, что нам повезло и место нас полностью устроило.

Отличное место. Уедиенное, но до пляжа 2 минуты. Пляж очень тихий и уютный, но в изобилии кафе, минимаркет с самым необходимым, прокат скутеров. Очень позитивный и обходительный хозяин. Оказывает помощь по любым вопросам.

Yun has excellent and quick communication. The security personnel at The Edge Condos were simply amazing. Yun even arranged a car to take me from the Bangkok Airport! All in all, a great place to stay.

To anyone reading this review.
We stayed in Pattaya for 2 weeks at 3 diffraction locations and this one was by far the absolute best! The building is new, the pool and community areas were beautiful. Exactly as advertised.
Yun is very responsive to the questions I had.
My only disappointment was leaving lol
5 out of 5 would recomend!

Outstanding place to stay in central pattaya, so chic and classy with sufficient space in condos. Yun was highly responsive and helpful. Highly recommended !!

Phanpilai is very quick to respond, and communication is clear and direct. It’s a shame that the rooftop infinity pool still wasn’t fixed during my stay, but otherwise have no issues with it. Thanks for hosting me!

The room is perfect and thank god I can find such a perfect accommodation for this trip. Bee's photos about the house accurately show every detail. You can confidently make your decision based on the photos. The big room is well furnitured and very clean. Bee has provided you most things you need for a long-term trip, If you live here, you can have a 5-mins walk to the biggest shopping mall in Pattaya, everything you need and want to eat could be found there. Standing on the balcony, you can have a whole view of the ocean, wonderful scenery! In addition, the BASE has the best infinity pool in Pattaya, you must try it!

This was a fantastic stay! The condo looks just like the photos. Very well taken care of, beautifully decorated, clean and in a great location. Bee is such a responsive host and communicates quickly and clearly. Extremely thoughtful.
Spent 3 weeks here in Pattaya. Great location in walking distance to the beach and easy access to many eateries, Central Festival(Biggest mall in pattaya), Starbucks, big supermarket, soi Buakao are within walking distance(3~5min), and Walking street is 5 min by Grab.
Thank you so much hosting us at this special occasion!
Before we didn’t realize there are 2 types of 1-bed rooms at the base central condo, last time we stayed at a smaller room without knowing, and much more expensive too… most of 1-bed rooms are 30sqm, no balcony unlike this one. We enjoyed seaview from the room and the balcony and spacious and beautiful living room watching Neflix. The room is high up and had great view of the bay, room is divided in 4 function from living room, bedroom, toilet and kitchen. We went to the roof top pool by walk too and it’s spectacular view.

혹시나 제 후기를 한국인 여행객이 본다면..
이 숙소가 비어있음에 ,예약할 수 있음에 감사하면됩니다. 콘도 중에서는 최고의 보안과 시설 및 지원하며 잘 이용하지 않겠지만 수영장또한 훌륭하다. 침구류는 깨끗하며 5성급 호텔 수준과 비교해도 손색없다. 호스트 지속적인 피드백을 통해 필요한 부분을 지원해주었으며..
휴지,수건,세제(주방.세탁.섬유유연제)바디워시.샴푸. 욕실슬리퍼가 준비되어있으며

멀티탭또함 아주 편리하게 되어있다.
티비는 보지않았지만 넷플릭스연결이 가능하며 소파에서 보기에 편했다.

장기숙박에만 주어지는 기회를 단기로 머물게 할수있어서 영광이었고

아쉬운점이 있다면 기본 제공 식수가 준비되어있지않기 때문에 체크인전 구매후 들어가길 바란다. 가까운 편의점이270m 거리의 3분거리에있으며 왔다갔다하기 상당히 귀찮다. 그만큼 단지 내 입점 한 매점이없어서 환경은 매우깨끗하며 관리에 대한 벌금부과도 철저한편

콘도중에선 여기룸 컨디션이 최고

It was a great stay at Li's place. We had a little bit of a problem at check-in but it was resolved quickly. I would stay here again.

I will say right up front, Li is an excellent host! Communication between her and I was fast, polite and professional. Anytime I had a question or concern she messaged me straightaway. The first unit she first put me in was dirty, but she was not aware of that, so it was simply an over sight. The cleaning lady clearly did not do a good job, and now I understand that person is no longer on Li’s staff. Once I messaged Li about this situation, she immediately offered me in another place that was very clean. The unit was very comfortable! Everything worked great. TV had many quality channels. The internet was very fast. The two aircon’s got as cold as desired. The bathroom had a lot of space around the vanity to put toiletries on. The shower was nice and hot with good water pressure. The unit has a good amount of shelving and closets to put your belongings away and keep organized. The kitchen had everything needed to cook and eat meals, and had a nice full sized refrigerator/freezer. One of my favorite amenities was the quality clothes washer on the balcony. It worked great! The condo is very centrally located in Pattaya. Another nice amenity was a quality gym that I took full advantage of. Bottom line, this place is quite comfortable, and is a good bargain for the listing price. I would stay here again, and I recommend to all!

Li is a very good host, friendly and professional! Communication between us was quite good, any question I had she messaged me straightaway. Li ended up moving me to a much better apartment because her cleaning person did not do a good job cleaning the original place I was to have stayed in. I understand that person is not employed on Li's staff any longer, so I'm sure that will not be a future issue. The apartment she moved me to was nice, and I was very comfortable there! Many TV channels, super fast internet! Aircon units got as cold as needed. Kitchen had things required for preparing meals, as well as a full sized refrigerator/freezer. Bathroom had a nice amount of space for toiletries, and the shower worked very well with good water pressure. On the balcony is a quality washing machine that worked perfectly. This apartment is great value for the money. I would stay again and recommend to all!

Everything about the unit was as advertised. However, once I arrived, I've noticed the bed mattress was too hard for me to sleep on. On the following day, I've reached out to Lilian and explain the situation. To make or to resolve the issue, Lilian went out of her way and found another unit with a mattress that would work and switched the unit. Also, she did not charge for any additional or difference in fee. Lilian was great and I am glad that I opted to use someone like Lilian to make my reservation. Thank you Lilian....

It's a great location, fast internet, stylish lobby and pool area. Gym is decent for a hotel style gym. Security is a bit ridiculous about not letting taxis pick you up at the lobby. Delivering food to the lobby is fine though. Anyway it's a good deal and the host was very pleasant to deal with.

Great place, nice amenities such as washing machine, warm water, big bed, and free parking with security.

The location of The Base makes it very easy to get good inexpensive food, and walk to Beach Road. The pool on the roof of building A is awesome!
The condo is small but is perfect for 1 or 2 people.
The only downside to The Base is the fact that the gym is very small and many people use it. Pick early in the day for your workout.
My condo was clean and had everything I needed to stay there for 3 weeks.

The apartment is clean and cozy. The A/C work fantastic, the location is awesome, there is plenty of parking. You are walking distance from restaurants, massage places and you can rent a bike very close. The owner is always very attentive and the person in contact to received us was there at our arrival. I will definitely stay there again, very please with the place and the service

the house can be considered clean in general, it is cheap and not bad for a couple taking a short vacation, the location of the house is far from the center, but there are markets and restaurants where you can find everything you are looking for. they have tools. the host is a good host. I rented this house for about 10$ per day for about 5 days, so it was enough for 10$, but if your expectations are high, I don't think that luxury and comfortable flashy items will be suitable for overly meticulous guests, you won't find salt sugar coffee tea, hand soap, face towel at home! Instead of pillowcases or duvet covers for soft pillows or terry sheets in white color, you will find that they are colored. The air conditioner works well, this is very important, I repeat, for me alone and for its reasonable price, this house is a very suitable place for those who want a normal, cheap and clean house, but I cannot recommend this house to meticulous guests with high expectations.

Jackrit was a wonderful and amazing host. Her parents met us at checkin and showed us around the condo, made sure we got connected to the wifi and were very friendly and helpful. The condo is conveniently located with the Jomtien beach right across the street, restaurants all around, a Family Mart very close, laundry service in the building at reasonable price and baht buses on the bach road to take you clear into Pattaya for 20 baht. Excellent place and excellent value. Thank you Jackrit. We will definitely stay with you again the next time we are in Pattaya. Much better than advertised! We had a great time.

Overall and amazing cozy home that will feel like your home too. Stay for 3 weeks and got weekly clean ups which was very nice. The location was nice in the middle of everything. Communication was very fast and clear. What makes this house so special is the people who manage it and help keep it alive. The staff at the property is so kind and sweet always so attentive to go above and beyond your needs.

Great location for the Jomtien Pattaya Beach scene. Laid-back. Peaceful. Family oriented. Beautiful condo room may be a bit dated but wonderfully spacious and opens to the sea. You’re literally a two minute walk to the beach. JetSkis and other rental opportunities available. Easy to commute to central Pattaya and back. Numerous restaurants and 7-11s all around. Night market has awesome Thai and western food. There were a few issues that Ken dealt with immediately and we appreciated that courtesy. Having two complete bathrooms is really a great benefit especially with kids. The local staff is helpful. Check in and out easy. And sunset views every night from the balcony was always a highlight. We look forward to returning.

We, my wife and I, spent a week in this spacious apartment. We appreciated the location which is as close to beach as you can get in Jomtien. The apartment is well equipped and well maintained. A great coffee shop is just in front of the building and there’s a 7-11 next to it. There are great street food stalls as well. Building staff was friendly and helpful. Probably the best feature is the large balcony where winds from the sea provided relief from the blisteringly hot May weather. Both Ken and his local team replied promptly to our messages.

I came to Pattaya almost 10 times and this was the best place to stay at pattaya
Location is center of the center to everywhere, condo is newly built and with so many luxury facilites even better than hilton and the price was much much cheaper

If you are looking for your holiday stay about 1~2weeks, this condo would be best choice
Location is best with access to Soi Buakao, restaurants and bars, beach, walking street and central festival shopping mall and so on
But the condo room is very quiet

The view from the rooptop pool and garden is just astonishing and sky lounge and gym is probably the best in Thailand

And the perfect Seaview from the room makes the stay perfect

Strongly recommend this condo and the room

The room is perfect and thank god I can find such a perfect accommodation for this trip. Bee's photos about the house accurately show every detail. You can confidently make your decision based on the photos. The big room is well furnitured and very clean. Bee has provided you most things you need for a long-term trip, If you live here, you can have a 5-mins walk to the biggest shopping mall in Pattaya, everything you need and want to eat could be found there. Standing on the balcony, you can have a whole view of the ocean, wonderful scenery! In addition, the BASE has the best infinity pool in Pattaya, you must try it!

Some answers for frequently asked questions:

- The Beach -
This is a calm and shallow beach most of the time during the year, it's safe for family with children although some of you might find it's too shallow to swim in.
It's a beautiful quiet beach with amazing sunset and overlooking the famous Koh Samui Big Buddha, also a few all year swimmable beach is just a few mins away.

1. All my photos are REAL from REAL SHOT
2. I also work with real estate agents and take long term bookings, that's why I don't have many reviews, but I still nailed the super host ;)
3. All the calendars are up to date, if some dates are not able to book, means dates are already been booked.
4. None of our rental properties provide condiments, because of hygiene concern. Travel size condiments are very affordable and easy to find on the island.
5. The reason I charge electricity fee on top of the rent:
(1) The rent I'm asking for is not much comparing with the other properties on the same standard. This is an island after all electricity cost is slightly higher than city.
(2) I used to face this situation a lot that guests were a bit careless about electricity usage because they're not paying the bill - keep aircon on when they're out, open the windows when ac are on, keep the pool light and jacuzzi on all night..
So I start thinking people might care more if they're responsible for their own electricity usage, and I have brought down the price and separated electricity cost from it - it's been working well!
Please feel free to message me if you want to know the estimate cost for your stay :)

Jillian was a fabulous host who was amazing both before and during our stay. Her team welcomed us and were there for any requests. The Villa was amazing. Spacious for the two of us and had spectacular views of the sunset each night. The pool although shared was very quiet and we got to use it loads. Overall a wonderfully quiet retreat but close to all amenities. Loved it!!

Excellent apartment in a great location looking just as good in real life as it does in the pictures. Jillian makes checking in / out easy and also had some great links of places to go / eat on the island. 100% recommended for a great family holiday.

Great house in a perfect location - near to quite a number of attractions and amenities but just far enough for our young family to rest in the evenings away from the crowds. House is fully equipped, with a fantastic view of the bay and Big Buddha, which made for some spectacular sunsets. We took full advantage of arranging massages out on the patio and help with car or bike rentals can be easily arranged. Thanks again to Jillian, Khun Nuy and their team!

The villa itself was small and cozy . I wouldn’t exactly call it luxury compared to all the luxury villas that are located all around Koh Samui . There is issues with electrical load in the villa , and if too many appliances are running at once , the circuit breaker might go off . The beach front description is true but please take into consideration that it’s not really that much of a beach . It’s located in small bay , so any kind of idea of a sandy beachfront is minimal at best .

Overall the villa is a nice Beach House . That’s what it’s called . It’s well kept in terms of cleanliness, and the Host is super friendly, and provides great communication during your stay . If you want a nice getaway along side the sea , with some great views of the ocean , this is a nice place .
Response from Jillian
April 2021
Thank you for you review Stephen and It was great to get to meet you and your family too! Really appreciate your feedback, it's important for us to improve our service.
First of all I'm very sorry about the power outage, Koh Samui's power system is still recovering from the main incident that was so bad and been on the news - a navy ship anchored the main undersea cable that supplies power from the mainland to Samui, and they might still need another two weeks to properly fix it.. I'm truly sorry it affected your holiday too..
And also indeed it's a weird year, the beach normally shows up on low tide days however it's been a few months for high tide already, which I really can't explain this but another thought, it's also makes the kayaks activities easier here, and makes the beautiful Koh Som island on the right hand side of our beach easier to access during high tide.
I'm personally a real estate developer, our team is passionate on high quality construction as well as art sense of each different projects, whenever you come back on Samui I would love have the chance to host you and your family again, hopefully the villas in our other projects can match your luxury definition.
And of course with a decent discount as return guest, also as a little make up for the disappointment of this stay.. I'm so sorry about that..
Stay safe and take care Stephen, hope to see you next time!

Jillian's villa is exceptional. It has been built and decorated to high standards and has everything you can wish for. The views are amazing with sunsets to die for. The pool is also first class, overlooking the ocean. The location is perfect - close to Fisherman's village, Chaweng and Lamai. Jillian and Khun Ice looked after us superbly and we would return in a heartbeat.

Breathtaking views, amazing accommodations, brilliant location, quality service, and tranquility. Our family really enjoyed the views poolside all day and during sunset it's gorgeous. The house was quiet and very comfortable with a fully stocked kitchen making it easy to cook up a quick meal. We arrived Christmas eve and were met by Jillian who showed us about and even presented us with a family Christmas gift, so sweet! They were kind enough to have a few essentials in the fridge which was greatly appreciated. Jillian arranged for in house massages, how glorious to go from the pool to getting a wonderful massage. New Years Eve she arranged for a BBQ seafood lunch that was brought to the house, prepared on site, and they cleaned everything up. The lunch was more than we could eat and prepared to perfection. Access to the kayaks was a blast - the water is smooth and scenery is spectacular. We were minutes from a grocer, restaurants, temples, shopping, etc.. Fisherman's village just a quick cab ride down the road, offered an abundance of souvenir, clothing, and dining options as well. Bonus!! The house was cleaned every few days, fresh sheets, and towels provided. Not expected... but greatly appreciated. This is a highly recommended gem in paradise!

Yu is a amazing host I with perfect communication and caring skills. After the stay want to stay in touch with Yu and invite him for dinner someday.

the location is between 2 beaches and plenty of fine dining, 5 star hotels with facilities, local shops, 3 money changers and plenty of restaurants.

the location is easy for food delivery and very safe at night. i only wish i stayed here longer.

hope to be your guest again someday!

I stayed at Yu's place for 3 months total and had a fantastic experience! The front desk girls Pichie and Taan are both super helpful with all things and speak great English. Let them know if you need a taxi or motorbike to get around, they'll help you right away. With just a short walk to the beach, the 2 pools downstairs and the gym in the same building I had everything I needed. Will definitely being staying here again if/ when I find myself back in Samui.

A great place to stay as the pictures describe, very relaxing and quiet in horizon residence complex. Close to a village and choeng mon beach but better to explore on a motorbike or car

It was a decent place, a little dirty but decent. A very good location. I had to leave early for family reasons so I didn’t stay the full 30 days, I left 10 days early and the host would NOT give any sort of refund. Keep in mind if you stay here and something goes wrong and you have to leave early, she will not accommodate any sort of refund. Also, her response time isn’t great. Sometimes took 1-2 days for her to respond to a simple question. Overall, it’s decent.

Check In was difficult because lady was not notified the room was booked.
AC needs to be serviced, not Cold and air is dirty. I now have sinus infection. Headache, Nose runny and cough a lot.
We booked during Grand Prix Race. Mr. Doungsawart did Excellent job telling me of possible problems like crowded parking and road closure during daytime race time. Thank you very much.
Watching race from room was Outstanding and exciting.
If Race Fan I recommend.
I like Bang Saen Walking street for food. 1 vendor makes the Best American Hamburger I've eaten in Thailand. Unfortunately Walking Street closed for race, but again Mr. Doungsawart told me before booking.
Give Mr. Doungsawart personally 5 STARS for Honest, Helpful Owner.
Thank You Mr. Doungsawart.

This appartment ist just a hidden diamond!!! The pictures look amazing already, but when you walk into the appartment the first time, you really think you are in heaven or dreaming. The location directly on the beach and it’s view is just impressive. The appartment is an corner appartment with a big balcony around the corner. Doungsawart put so much love into the details and everything was just perfect. From the first minute on in it felt like home for me. The area is much more quiet and clean as at bang saen beach, and if you want to go to any bars, you can easily take a grab taxi or Songtail. The songtail Station is just a 5 Minute Walk and also 2 7/11 are just nearby. There is a great weekend night market and also a yammi ice cream and bakery place just around the corner. Very convenient: there is a water machine downstairs where you can fill up your water bottles for just 1 bath. Unfortunately the washing machine in front of the building was removed, but there is some laundry services nearby, just need to take the songtail or taxi, put in your laundry and enjoy the meantime with a nice drink at the restaurants. If the appartment wasn’t booked out, I would have definetely extended my stay. Doungsawart was always reachable and made everything very clear. I will definitely Come back

It's been a really nice stay in the base for the whole month. Close to the central festival and near lots of shops. The house keeper is friendly, if you need new beddings just ask them and they will come to change for the new beds for you. Bad thing about it is the wifi is slow that's all. Overall the condo room is great. Will definitely be back. Thank you

Cons:
- Wi-Fi is really low speed, sometimes you can’t even watch YouTube on 1 device. Mobile internet(operator “true”) has bad connection on this floor as well. So if you need internet - choose the different apartment.
- No cleaning. It was promised in description when we booked as weekly cleaning, but when we asked about it - owner told us that it’s not actual and we can take it by ourselves.

Pros:
- wonderful view
- location
- enough kitchen stuff
- pool and coworking are nice options
- good air conditioners

This 2 bedroom had the best views of any condo I have stayed during my many visits to Pattaya. The living area was more than big enough for a family and all rooms had AC which was amazing.

For me, the only downside to this condo was the Internet. As someone who uses a computer a lot the Internet speed was shockingly bad andwhen asked if they were able to provide a quicker speed I was advised no. After staying in the condo I would recommend if Internet speed is important then maybe bring a 5g router or even the host could provide one rather than the slow 4g they have.

Internet aside, this condo was great. The location is second to none but was still quiet every night so sleep was no issue.

I would 100% stay again but would bring a better Internet solution over what the host provided.

Very nice place to stay in Pattaya. It is pretty central to everything. Awesome views of the beach from the balcony (though there could be a high building going up in front of it in the next few months) it is a little smaller than you get from the pics. All in all it was well worth it for my stay. Erin responds very quickly to all questions.

August 2022
This property has not been reviewed in more than 2 years (since the start of the pandemic) so I will do my best to provide an updated assessment.

To begin with, the main reason that I selected Mum's place is because of its proximity to the beach. While there is a "Jomtien Beach Condominium" on Beach Road, that is not where it is located. Instead, it is on Second Road in the middle of three massive residential buildings. The entire complex has clearly seen better days. The majority of units (at least 75%) appear to be empty. A sign hanging on one of the balconies states that rooms rent for 5500 baht/month.

The studio itself is decent, though not nearly as immaculate as presented in the photos. (I presume either they were taken shortly after construction or highly edited.) Despite arriving two hours after the check-in time, the unit was still being cleaned. It also wasn't equipped with basic essentials such as toilet paper, soap, or shampoo. More importantly, the refrigerator did not work. To their credit, the hosts responded to my messages very promptly. After four days without a working fridge, they sent a brand new one.

There is a gym on the property but, like the expats who live there, the equipment is woefully outdated. The cardio equipment is covered in rust and, with the exception of one treadmill, does not operate. On the positive side, you have the entire gym to yourself since nobody uses it.

The pool is, by far, the highlight of this otherwise dreary property. Be forewarned, however, of the prevalence of obese European geezers rocking banana hammocks. These people stopped caring what anybody else thought of them a long time ago.

In summary, you get what you pay for. I recommend spending a few extra dollars a night and staying at one of the newer properties that looks and feels like a resort. For longer term visitors, you can rent a fully furnished studio at the sleek and ultra modern Acqua Condominium Jomtien for 7000 baht/month (which is what I paid for less than two weeks here).

Excellent choice! Everything in this place is top-notch. Highly doubt that there is a place in Jomtien with better value.

Pros:
- Location (Could not be better. Away from all the fuss but only 5min walk to the Beach road. 7eleven, restaurants and breakfast joints just outside the condominium.)
- Host (Communication with the hosts is easy and overall very pleasant, starting with all the advise regarding check-in. By the way, the door has a number code so you don't have to carry a key with you.)
- Pool area (Clean and large.)

Cons:
- No kitchen (For longer stay, kitchen would be nice, although there are fridge, microwave and cutlery)

I recommend staying in Mum’s apartment. The location is great, only a few minutes from jomtien beach. There are restaurants and bars close by. The condo is clean and secure. The room is very clean and stylish. Mum is a great host that will solve any problem very quickly!

It’s a stylish refurbished studio unit that feels much larger than it is. Very clean, nicely furnished, comfortable bed and sofa, fast internet. Building is real Thailand - it has a friendly and relaxed atmosphere and is secure and convenient. Good location for Jomtien Beach and surrounding restaurants. Mum and Winthai were great in answering messages quickly and very helpful.

The apartment is so fabulous and has a good vibe, the two rooms have a king bed, the living room with Netflix tv, the restroom so amazing, and the European fully kitchen so amazing, I like everything, and I have been seriously getting chocked with of that professional work, since when I get in the apartment and they get me in a private WhatsApp group just for me since when I ask for any questions the first one see it they respond so quickly, the complex has a huge swimming pool and gym, and also car parking, the safety box in two rooms since you don't even need to put something inside it when already all complex it's safe, I would like to say please for who need to take the apartment to take care of it, and for a deposit, because I left early its take only one day work and it's in my account, really it's the best people so friendly and honest, thank you so much that 🙏🏾

August 2022
Joy and Alf’s apartment is truly beautiful. It’s actually nicer than what it even shows in the pictures. Alf was extremely accommodating and very helpful so I have nothing but good things to say on those two accounts.

The only challenge that I had was that the air conditioning was only in the bedroom and the rest of the house was so hot that I was unable to use or enjoy the space.

Because there aren’t any screens on the windows and the rustic nature of the home wouldn’t keep bugs out anyway, I couldn’t leave the windows open to circulate air because I have a sensitivity to mosquitoes.

Alf was very accommodating and understanding that I was only able to stay one night and ended up having to cancel the reservation.

Just be aware that if you do stay here, you will want to rent a motorbike or some mode of transportation. It’s not in a place where you can just go grab breakfast or a meal without significant walking.

Taxi’s on Koh Tao are also very expensive.

I think this is a wonderful place if you don’t mind heat in the living areas and you want to just be in the jungle.

It really is very beautiful.

Magnificent hosts, very helpful and courteous which makes up for the slow shower ( really the only little drawback for this place ). Strongly recommend. Close to beach and action, and at the same time located on the outside of it.

Great spot that's in between the two busiest areas of the island with the ability to have your privacy. Best to get a bike if you dont like walking hills (10 min walk both directions) but if you like a workout during the trip you'll get one, especially with the muay thai gym around the corner. The bungalow is incredibly spacious and stylish with a beautiful view of the jungle and the gulf. Great homely stay while enjoying Ko Tao.

Joy and Alf were a dream. They were so welcoming and helpful. The place was perfect for someone looking for a jungle oasis away from the tourist bustle. They also let us access the roof for lovely sunset views and gave great recommendations for things to do locally. If you're renting a scooter, which is recommended, Alf was very helpful coordinating the rental and made things very easy.
We'd 100% stay here again.

... I had great stay at Casper and Seven's condo. It is nicely decorated in a fun way with some cartoon (maybe anime) characters that children would enjoy. I liked it. Sheets had them too. It's a newish and extremely clean condo that seems a little larger than other Airbnb's I've stayed at here in Thailand. One of the things i really liked is that it's in a corner of the building and has a side window which can give it some cross ventilation. This has always been huge for me as I like to ventilate with fresh air daily. The kitchen is well equipped with pots, pans, dishes, toaster, coffee maker etc with stove burners and a microwave where I did daily cooking. Everything seemed new to include the refrigerator. I slept very comfortably here; I think the bed might be an orthopedic type because the back pain I was having when I came stopped within a few days. The washer on the balcony worked well and I was able to do a daily load. Big TV with Netflix did it's job. What else... Casper and Seven were extremely responsive to messages and always got back to me immediately after I messaged them. The location couldn't be more perfect being in the center of town close to the shopping, dining, and entertainment areas of Hua Hin. This building has a very beautiful pool by the way. Fitness room looks nice as well You know something else about the building, the staff here is amazing. Management, security, housekeeping and maintenance are the most friendly and polite people in the world. They treated me like I was an owner rather than just a temporary guest. I extended my stay twice and stayed over a month. I would stay here again for sure.

Top location; comfortable apartament; perfect communication with Hosts. They left for us welcome drinks and tasty coffee capsules - thank You guys! Huge plasma TV with every app like Apple TV etc. Washing machine on balcony. Everything is new and clean, so you can feel like in your own new home. There is a swimming pool also - I thought (from web pictures) that it can be small- but it is the longest swimming pool we got in our 4 months trip - perfect for swimming, but also for just relaxing - nice garden around.
Highly recommended - no better place in Hua Hin, trust me!!!

Hi Yunlin,
It's nice staying at your accommodation. The place is very very clean, comfortable and convenient. The bed is nice and comfy. It allows me to sleep well at night which is not quite usual when we travel and stay over night at new places. It's changed our mindset about staying in Airbnb places. The place is close to Hua Hin beach, 5-10 minute walk. The swimming pool is clean, beautiful and private. The staff is nice and can speak English fluently. My kids and I love the place a lot and we definitely visit your place again if we have a chance to come to Hua Hin. Keep up the good work.

Yunlin and Seven are wonderful hosts. They go the extra mile to ensure that we had a wonderful stay. Easily reachable and very willing to help in many ways.

Room has a wonderful view and vibe. It is located in a quiet corner of the condo overlooking the pool. The condo conveniently located near to many amenities, restaurants and malls. It has an affordable restaurant right beside it, a 1 minute walk to 7-11 and 5 mins walk to a supermarket. Due to the convenient location, you do not have to spend much time or money to order food through grab, or to travel to any destinations nearby.

Condo staff and 24hr security are also very friendly and helpful.

Would 100% recommend to stay here.

The place was a great value for the money and Amaraporn was a spectacular host. The place is walking distance to everything and has all the essential things you need for a short stay. I will definitely look for this room again when I return to Pattaya.

My family and I really enjoyed our stay! The house was clean and ready for guests. It was in a phenomenal vacation spot! It was steps away from the beach and eateries. The host was very responsive, and the maid was very helpful and kind. I’d certainly recommend this location to friends, and we hope to return soon!

It's picture-perfect duplex with all amenities. We even cooked some small meals, the kitchen has all the utensils.
Beach is EXACTLY 20-25 meters, in the night it's marvelous to seat on the stairs to the beach with beer(s) and your partner/friends. Area/locality if fully residential - non-crowded, so you can have excellent serenity as well.
We loved it and felt sad to leave the house.

Thank you for taking such a great care of my family. We had a wonderful time and the house is just a few steps away from the beach. Special thanks the housekeeping attendant, I could not remember her name but she was very sweet and told us about the best place to buy seafood. It’s a local market and the price is extremely cheap. We brought some fresh seafood from there and did use the grill from the house. Beds are comfortable and the house is very clean. I would definitely recommend this place and probably will be back.

This property was great. Our family of 4 (kids 12 and 7) stayed here for two nights. The rooms were clean and spacious. The living area was open and had a lot of nice touches (karaoke machine, kids toys, smart TV). The beach access was perfect and actually was a much nicer (less rocks, less people, less trash) area than the “official” Hua Hin beach. We would definitely stay again.

February 2020
It is a very clean place. For a the money, it is a great place and has every thing you need. Is you are looking for some thing closer to the beach and over looking the bay; this is not it.
However, easy check in, amazing pool and quiet environment. Stay away from taxi service across the street. It is a rip off. For taxi service, walk a bit further up towards town and you can get cheaper prices for your destinations.
Over all I give it 4 stars!

Great apartment, super clean, with a responsive host. Loved being close to the beach and away from the hustle and bustle. Would definitely stay here again.

A great place if you want to relax. A short walk to the beach. While not in the heart of the city a short taxi ride will get you to some great markets and restaurants.

Anyas place was conveniently located. The guards at the entrance of the condo were very friendly.

August 2018
Anya was a pleasant host, and provided a comfortable place that did the job! Really basic simple room to sleep, and minimal provisions. Condo complex was ok with only the simplest basic facilities. It is only a few minutes walk to the local beach. It is a little remote away from much activity, but it was advertised as such. Still a nice place and neighborhood. Small studio with basics provided, no extras. No cable TV or foreign language channels (only few local Thai channels), and not DVD or other entertainment in the room or building. Did the job!

The property is simply gorgeous. The location makes you work for it a little bit - from Bangkok, a flight to Samui and then the ferry to the island. But once all of this is behind, you get a really nice house on top of a hill, overlooking a major part of the island.
Put simply, the views of the sea are spectacular; from the bedrooms, the bathrooms, the terrace, the kitchen, etc...
The house is quite recent (one year old, I am told), very spacious, equipped with top quality appliances and furnished with style and taste.
There is a lady staying there during the day looking after the house and is always at hand to help if needed.
I was welcome warmly by Mathilde who can share with you any tip you may require during your stay.

All in all, this is a beautiful and quiet house in a very beautiful location. Worth the trip, definitely!

Mathilde was an absolute gem. 5-star hospitality! The villa has an excellent view overlooking SriThanu, with a ton of great restaurants and cafes within 5 min scooter ride.

The villa is beautifully designed and well appointed. The villa even has its own branded soap, shampoo, etc. Our favorite was the Pandan scented body lotion! Very luxurious!!

Our stay at Shambala villa has been 10 out of 10! The huge livingroom has been styled with Asian art, it is a dream to use the fully equiped kitchen's cooking island, and if you open up the 12 meters long sliding door, the patio feels like an integrated part of the living room. The salt water infinity pool brings out the inner child, but for us the highlight is the view. One overlooks the west side of Koh Phangan, the lush green of the tropical forrest, the Hin Kong beach and of course the ocean. We used the spa in the garden twice. Service was top notch too: when we asked for a barbecue the owner delivered it the same day, Mathilde the manager is very welcoming and Ju the maid is a sweatheart . Honestly we tried, but we could not detect any flaws. 😃

We enjoyed the time at the villa to the fullest. We will probably never forget the moment when we opened the door to the villa and were allowed to admire the breathtaking views. The villa was equipped with a lot of love for detail. Each room is unique and equipped with its own beautiful bathroom.
It was the most beautiful and breathtaking house for all of us that we were ever allowed to live in. We already miss the villa and would love to come back anytime:)

Fantastic stay here. The house was perfect for us, amazing views and in a more quiet part of the island which was great for us. The interior was new and nice. The check in was very smooth and Jum and Jeff and the team were great, very helpful and accommodative especially when we had to stay late on the last day. Great place

Blanka and her team were fantastic from the moment we booked the property till the day we checked out. They were thoughtful, excellent in their communication, and always attentive to our needs.

As for the property, the pictures don't do it justice. It's a beautiful villa with an amazing view. There are a lot of amenities within 10minutes of the villa, and there were plenty of restaurants that delivered food and groceries there as well. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to spend some time in Koh Samui that's looking for a beautiful, peaceful property with a view.

Our heartfelt gratitude to Blanka and her team for making our trip a memorable one. Thank you

Fantastic stay at Samui Bayside. This is our third time we have stayed in this area. There is a reason we keep coming back. This villa is very luxurious and beautiful. Perfect for families, in a little quieter part of the island. The views are amazing. Great communication with the host and the management team, who are very professional and catered to our every need (even on short notice requests). Cannot recommend this place highly enough. We are definitely coming back to Samui Bayside next time we visit Koh Samui :)

We had a fantastic stay at Samui Bayside. The beautiful view is incredible. The team looked after us very well and we were extremely happy. We were working (internet was fantastic) so we didn’t mind being in the quieter part of town. No problem getting grab deliveries and taxis to and from the villa. Highly recommend this wonderful villa, it truly is paradise.

Very nice, tidy and beautiful property for a family with great location and gorgeous views! Steps away from a very quiet and beautiful beach. Blanka and her team were very hospital, attentive, caring and responsible! I’m very much satisfied with my family stay, recommend everybody!

Great views, great sunsets. Very poor communiation with host, we were accused of some very strange behaviour after our checkin, when it later turned out to be some other guests in another apartment that had done this, not us, communation could definitely be improved.

A lot of small things not working or just partly working in the apartment on arrival, like the fridge, cloth washing machine, ceiling fan, lights in the pool. We had to spend alot of time communicating things that werent working and letting maintenance guys in the apartment.

The beach near the apartment is completely dead, no shops, restaurants or anything open nearby the apartment, could be due to covid though.

Perfect tropical paradise! Very good location, walking distance (10m) to Thong Sala pier, night market and central, but still very quiet, no noise from the street. Right outside the resort there are laundry (24h or express), restaurants, a pub and bike rental shop. The A/C is efficient and silent. The room is stylish, the bad is big and comfortable. Julia was super fun to meet, he welcomed me the first second when I arrived at the gate. It felt safe, there is also a locker. Want to go back!

Amazing stay - beautiful clean and spacious villa and Simon is the best host! Always available to answer any questions and very accommodating.

Can’t recommend highly enough!! Must stay for a private and fun experience in koh samui

The villa is located in a quiet small compound off from the main street but close to convenience stores, nice restaurants, bakery, a fresh market and a few beaches. The beds are confortable and the aircon was quiet. If you want to cook your own meals the kitchen is well equipped with an oven. Also, it's decorated with good taste. Simon is very reactive, flexible and always ready to help. Thank you for the stay!

I booked Simon's Villa to my little brother and to his wife. It was my wedding present to them. Here is their review to Simon:

We enjoyed our holiday in Koh Samui which was our honeymoon. The villa was really nice and well-equipped, pool area, parking space, everything was just ok. The location of the villa was really good, we had our private peaceful place and still everything (shops, restaurants, pharmacy, beach, Big Buddha) was close. We had a little problem with air conditioning which was difficult (or impossible?) to adjust, it was either full speed or off. But it didn't ruin our vacation which was happy and gave us a lot of great memories. Thank you Simon for everything!

Very small, clean, apartment (perfect for 2 persons), good location, beautiful view, easy to check in, easy communication with the owner. The only things that are missing, but which are easy to fix - a kitchen towel or napkins, more cutlery, dishes, a kettle. We spent Saturday night in the apartment, so there was a nightlife behind the windows, as well as in the hallway. But everything is good relative to the price. Recommended for enjoying holidays in Central Pattaya.

The pictures Isabelle represented us on Airbnb were very beautiful and luxury but when we got there we were very disappointed! Everything was not clean, in a very old and bad condition with a lot of mould in the bathroom, couches, cheers and garden furnitures! The pool was not safe because a lot of peace’s were missing and we felt very uncomfortable, we didn’t wanted to sleep there even one night. For Thailand standards Isabelles‘s Villas have a very hight price with no service at all. We did not stay there but we didn’t got our money back from Isabelle and therefore we had a lot of trouble and a very bad holiday. We hope no one else will have the same experience we had!

This comment is inaccurate and misleading. Your refund request has been rejected by Airbnb for lack of truth on your part. You did not have a correct attitude and even less in the context of the reception AIrbnb.

Great house and amazing location near srithanu. Only issue is lack of hot shower, so if this is essential to you it’s not the place. Otherwise great!

Regarding hot water, we have a temperature variator that you certainly have not put in hot position! It was enough to ask us and we would have shown you how to solve it! By default, it is warm to avoid accidents with water too hot.

Beautiful and charming place, with all the wonderful cats and dogs, the atmosphere is super lovely and cool!
Isabelle is a great, kind and very helpful host, the villa is full of her soulful touches, it was a real pleasure to communicate with her and she made our stay even more enjoyable.

And we definitely would recommend to check out Maggie’s handcraft, villas are decorated with pieces of her amazing work which you can buy as we did)

Overall highly recommended wonderful place!

I had the perfect stay at The Tipi.

I stayed for one month in one of their stilt little houses and everything was perfect.

It has everything you need: a little kitchen, a terrace with a hammock, private bathroom and great wifi connection for the ones that work remotely.

Skye is a great host. Him and Fern helped me arranging the bike rental, recommended me places to visit and more.

I can't recommend this place enough. Thank you for a lovely stay!

My stay at this place was just wonderful!
It's quiet and beautiful, you have everything you need and if you dont't have it, Skye will do it's best to help with everything. There even is a gym.
The place is located perfectly on the island, not far from Zenbeach (my favourite beach) and not too far from the 'citycenter'.
I will defenitely come back!

Large spacious bungalow with large veranda and view of the greenery.

Super location. Resturans cafes and bars are a few minutes away.
Internet was not so good but Skye took care of it. It should be better now. :)

Skye is the warmest and most genuine host you can imagine. The place is fantastic too, I stayed here for 2 weeks and by all means it was my favorite place to stay in all Thailand. The place is super clean, quiet, I loved the spacious terrace with the hammock. It also has a small kitchenette which is so convenient for longer stays. The location is also great, situated on the west coast of the island, close to the amazing beaches, so easy to catch the most beautiful sunsets.

Everyone will be so lucky to stay at the amazing Tipi! Thank you Skye, hope to be back soon ❤️
